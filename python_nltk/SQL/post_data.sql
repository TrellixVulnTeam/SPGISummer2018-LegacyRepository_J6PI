Maybe pigs and dolphins are next.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this analysis is that the monkeys formed their portfolios by choosing stocks so that each stock (of 1000 in the test universe) had an equal likelihood of being selected and/or overweighted by each monkey. This more or less guarantees that the monkeys\' portfolios, perhaps with a very few exceptions, will have a small cap bias. In a period when we know that small size paid off, it\'s not surprising that the monkeys outperform cap weighting.\r\n\r\nOne of the virtues of a cap-weighted index is that it accurately reflects the nature of the investor\'s opportunity set. Otherwise said, the world is cap-weighted. An investment dollar chosen at random is not equally likely to be invested in Apple Computer as on the smallest stock in the universe. It is much more likely to be invested in Apple.

Additionally, foreclosure activity continues to decline even though it remains at elevated levels compared to the period before the financial crisis.\r\n\r\n“Three of the five cities we cover showed decreases in their default rates in February – New York was down by 12 basis points, Los Angeles by 18 and Miami by 24 basis points.

In recent years it seems like everyone is bashing cap-weighted indices, so it was probably only a matter of time until apes took a shot. Maybe pigs and dolphins are next.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this analysis is that the monkeys formed their portfolios by choosing stocks so that each stock (of 1000 in the test universe) had an equal likelihood of being selected and/or overweighted by each monkey. This more or less guarantees that the monkeys\' portfolios, perhaps with a very few exceptions, will have a small cap bias. In a period when we know that small size paid off, it\'s not surprising that the monkeys outperform cap weighting.\r\n\r\nOne of the virtues of a cap-weighted index is that it accurately reflects the nature of the investor\'s opportunity set. Otherwise said, the world is cap-weighted. An investment dollar chosen at random is not equally likely to be invested in Apple Computer as on the smallest stock in the universe. It is much more likely to be invested in Apple. The monkeys presumably did not know this, and thus, in a particular way, behaved anything but randomly.','',89,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/04/11/89-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0);

If some <i>soi-disant</i> index funds \"aren\'t,\" which ones \"are\" -- or, at the most basic level, what is an index?\r\n\r\nA good working definition of an index is this: an index is a portfolio in which constituent and weighting changes are not motivated by alpha-seeking. (Read \"alpha\" as excess or above-average return.) The contrast with active management is clear; the manager of an active portfolio typically <i>only makes changes</i> that are motivated by alpha-seeking. If not alpha, what objectives might drive the managers of index portfolios? Historically we can identify three stages of index evolution:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Asset class replication. A good example here is the S&amp;P 500, which aims to represent the U.S. equity market.</li>\r\n	<li>Subsets and extensions of basic asset class replication. Examples would include the S&amp;P MidCap 400 or Small Cap 600, as well as sector and style (growth and value) indices.</li>\r\n	<li>Factor or strategy indices -- e.g., the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility Index or the Dow Jones Select Dividend Index. The distinctive quality of factor indices is that they aim to deliver a particular pattern of returns -- in our examples, a pattern characterized by less volatility or higher yield.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt\'s this last category whose bona fides the Journal seemed to question, and admittedly the line between active and passive here is a bit more gray. (See, e.g., <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-the-limits-of-history.pdf\">http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-the-limits-of-history.pdf</a>.) But well-constructed factor indices can provide defined patterns of return without requiring the payment of active management fees.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, e.g., goes back to 1896; the first indexed institutional portfolios appeared in the 1970s, the first index mutual fund in 1976, and the first index-tracking exchange traded funds in the 1990s. In all these cases, the index provider was independent of the provider of the index-linked financial product.\r\n\r\nWe think that this independence is an under-appreciated aspect of the success and growth of indexed assets. There are three distinct steps that separate the investor from the product:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong> Data</strong> -- price and volume data must first be created (on a securities exchange or otherwise) and aggregated</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Index</strong> -- using price data and other inputs, an index is created</li>\r\n	<li><strong> Product</strong> -- an investment product is created by linking to an index</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIndependent index providers (ourselves prominent among them) occupy only the middle stage of this process.\r\n\r\nTo see why this is important, consider what happens when the second step is combined with either the first or the third. For an example of why combining the first two steps (data generation and index creation) is undesirable, think of the word \"LIBOR.\" The LIBOR scandals of the last year were only possible because the same entities controlled both the data and the index. An independent provider would have had the ability to audit and challenge the raw inputs, helping to insure the integrity if the index creation process.\r\n\r\nCombining steps two and three can be equally problematic, if less obviously so. When the same entity provides both index and product, how can the end user assess the performance of the index portfolio manager? And how can he know whether index construction decisions are being driven by the best interests of the client or by the commercial interests of the product provider?\r\n\r\nInvesting in an indexed product without an independent index provider is like playing tennis without a net. It may be good exercise, but it\'s not the same game.','',239,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/04/23/239-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0);

In recent years it seems like everyone is bashing cap-weighted indices, so it was probably only a matter of time until apes took a shot. Maybe pigs and dolphins are next.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this analysis is that the monkeys formed their portfolios by choosing stocks so that each stock (of 1000 in the test universe) had an equal likelihood of being selected and/or overweighted by each monkey. This more or less guarantees that the monkeys\' portfolios, perhaps with a very few exceptions, will have a small cap bias. In a period when we know that small size paid off, it\'s not surprising that the monkeys outperform cap weighting.\r\n\r\nOne of the virtues of a cap-weighted index is that it accurately reflects the nature of the investor\'s opportunity set. Otherwise said, the world is cap-weighted. An investment dollar chosen at random is not equally likely to be invested in Apple Computer as on the smallest stock in the universe. It is much more likely to be invested in Apple. The monkeys presumably did not know this, and thus, in a particular way, behaved anything but randomly.','',89,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/04/19/89-revision-5/',0,'revision','',0);

If some <i>soi-disant</i> index funds \"aren\'t,\" which ones \"are\" -- or, at the most basic level, what is an index?\r\n\r\nA good working definition of an index is this: an index is a portfolio in which constituent and weighting changes are not motivated by alpha-seeking. (Read \"alpha\" as excess or above-average return.) The contrast with active management is clear; the manager of an active portfolio typically <i>only makes changes</i> that are motivated by alpha-seeking. If not alpha, what objectives might drive the managers of index portfolios? Historically we can identify three stages of index evolution:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Asset class replication. A good example here is the S&amp;P 500, which aims to represent the U.S. equity market.</li>\r\n	<li>Subsets and extensions of basic asset class replication. Examples would include the S&amp;P MidCap 400 or Small Cap 600, as well as sector and style (growth and value) indices.</li>\r\n	<li>Factor or strategy indices -- e.g., the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility Index or the Dow Jones Select Dividend Index. The distinctive quality of factor indices is that they aim to deliver a particular pattern of returns -- in our examples, a pattern characterized by less volatility or higher yield.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt\'s this last category whose bona fides the Journal seemed to question, and admittedly the line between active and passive here is a bit more gray. (See, e.g., <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-the-limits-of-history.pdf\">http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-the-limits-of-history.pdf</a>.)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, e.g., goes back to 1896; the first indexed institutional portfolios appeared in the 1970s, the first index mutual fund in 1976, and the first index-tracking exchange traded funds in the 1990s. In all these cases, the index provider was independent of the provider of the index-linked financial product.\r\n\r\nWe think that this independence is an under-appreciated aspect of the success and growth of indexed assets. There are three distinct steps that separate the investor from the product:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong> Data</strong> -- price and volume data must first be created (on a securities exchange or otherwise) and aggregated</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Index</strong> -- using price data and other inputs, an index is created</li>\r\n	<li><strong> Product</strong> -- an investment product is created by linking to an index</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIndependent index providers (ourselves prominent among them) occupy only the middle stage of this process.\r\n\r\nTo see why this is important, consider what happens when the second step is combined with either the first or the third. For an example of why combining the first two steps (data generation and index creation) is undesirable, think of the word \"LIBOR.\" The LIBOR scandals of the last year were only possible because the same entities controlled both the data and the index. An independent provider would have had the ability to audit and challenge the raw inputs, helping to insure the integrity if the index creation process.\r\n\r\nCombining steps two and three can be equally problematic, if less obviously so. When the same entity provides both index and product, how can the end user assess the performance of the index portfolio manager? And how can he know whether index construction decisions are being driven by the best interests of the client or by the commercial interests of the product provider?\r\n\r\nInvesting in an indexed product without an independent index provider is like playing tennis without a net. It may be good exercise, but it\'s not the same game.','',239,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/04/29/239-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0);

As long as the Fed continues to effectively stimulate monetary policy with its monthly purchases of $85 billion in notes and mortgage bonds, this situation will most likely continue.\n\nAs the treasury curve is the basis of valuation for most debt, outside of Libor for loans and swaps, the currently advantageous environment applies to other asset classes of the capital markets as well. Corporate debt, as measured by the <b>S&amp;P U.S. Issued Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index</b>, has reached recent lows in May as the index\'s yield-to-worst stands at 2.50%. Below investment grade issuers, whose credit risks rating agencies view as a higher concern, and which comprise the <b>S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index,</b> are yielding 4.66% (YTW).\n\nTreasurers and CFOs across the market are touting this as the perfect time to refinance and strike deals, as the cost of financing is so low.  Companies are issuing various maturities of debt at a frenzied pace to an investor base that demands as much yield as it can get.  Such \"oversubscribed\" deals show that investors are piling into both investment grade and high yield paper.  Investors are frantically scooping up any product that provide yield, but are they turning a blind eye to the risks they are assuming?  As companies use these funds to realign their businesses, pay down older debt, start new projects, or create new ones, the benefits of current leveraging will only be determined in the future.  A more immediate effect, among others, has been the buyback of equity shares by a number of companies, as the S&amp;P 500 is up 14.06% year-to-date.\n\n&nbsp;','',311,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/05/13/311-revision/',0,'revision','',0);

(See <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/too-much-talk-about-liquidity/\" target=\"_blank\">Krugman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0810ce9a-be2c-11e2-9b27-00144feab7de.html#axzz2T8P7iqmP\" target=\"_blank\">Gillian Tett </a>or<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/05/22/dont-fear-the-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\"> Felix Salmon </a>among others) fueled by the market\'s gains since the start of the year and the usual worries that disaster will strike during the summer break at the beach.  There are optimists: some say that \"Sell in May and Go Away\" should be \"Buy in May and Make Hay.\"  Virtually all agree -- correctly -- that the Fed\'s low interest rates and QE3 policy is boosting stock prices. Further, all also agree, again correctly, that the Fed will sooner or later stop QE3 (or QE4 or QE5) and interest rates will rise. Rising interest rates are usually not the best medicine for the stock market although they don\'t spell complete or immediate doom.   Even with the Fed, QE3 and maybe some more QEs, the bubble fears look overdone from here.\r\n\r\nFirst, a bubble is more than anything that results in a crash and collapse.  A bubble usually builds itself on speculative mania as it departs from any link to funamental financial factors.  As the bubble worriers themselves demonstrate, there are plenty of people worrying that the market will collapse and very few expecting it to rise forever more from here.  We\'re not seeing genuine specualtive mania, at least not yet.  Remember \"Home Prices Never Fall\" or recall names like Pets.com?  Little of that is being seen in the market now.

At the other end of the spectrum, one of the worst-performing sectors earlier in the year was Technology (up only 5.54% while the S&amp;P 500 was rising 12.74%). In May, Technology was among the best performers (up 4.55% versus 2.34% for to market as a whole). Not surprisingly, this shift away from more defensive sectors caused strategies like low volatility and high dividends, which had been stellar performers between January and April, to lag considerably in May.\r\n\r\nOne obvious contributor to the rotation in equity sector performance was an equally notable shift in the bond market. At the long end of the curve, yields rose by more than 40 basis points in May. The S&amp;P/BGCantor 20+ Year US Treasury Index, which had risen modestly in the first four months of the year, declined -6.71% in May (its worst decline since April 2009).\r\n\r\nIt\'s not hard to make the case (e.g., see <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324423904578520970034006496.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324423904578520970034006496.html</a>) that as bond yields rose in May, higher-yielding equity sectors such as Utilities became less attractive to income seekers, leading to their underperformance. But what happens now? If bond rates continue to rise, how likely is it that the equity market will continue its recent strength?

(See <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/too-much-talk-about-liquidity/\" target=\"_blank\">Krugman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0810ce9a-be2c-11e2-9b27-00144feab7de.html#axzz2T8P7iqmP\" target=\"_blank\">Gillian Tett </a>or<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/05/22/dont-fear-the-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\"> Felix Salmon </a>among others) fueled by the market\'s gains since the start of the year and the usual worries that disaster will strike during the summer break at the beach.  There are optimists: some say that \"Sell in May and Go Away\" should be \"Buy in May and Make Hay.\"  Virtually all agree -- correctly -- that the Fed\'s low interest rates and QE3 policy is boosting stock prices. Further, all also agree, again correctly, that the Fed will sooner or later stop QE3 (or QE4 or QE5) and interest rates will rise. Rising interest rates are usually not the best medicine for the stock market although they don\'t spell complete or immediate doom.   Even with the Fed, QE3 and maybe some more QEs, the bubble fears look overdone from here.\r\n\r\nFirst, a bubble is more than anything that results in a crash and collapse.  A bubble usually builds itself on speculative mania as it departs from any link to funamental financial factors.  As the bubble worriers themselves demonstrate, there are plenty of people worrying that the market will collapse and very few expecting it to rise forever more from here.  We\'re not seeing genuine specualtive mania, at least not yet.  Remember \"Home Prices Never Fall\" or recall names like Pets.com?  Little of that is being seen in the market now. Second, while low interest rates are boosting stock prices, that is a fundamental financial factor making stock more attractive.  Of course, the key part of any bubble is when it bursts.  Bursting bubbles cause damge because they change the state of the world and because they pop when no one is expecting it.  Possibly the only thing being watched more carefully than the Dow and the S&amp;P these days is the Fed. And, unlike either the Dow or the S&amp;P, the Fed can send out warning signals -- and probably will when the time comes.\r\n\r\nWhere does all this leave us? Even without bubbles the market can go down.  We used to call those disappointments corrections.  The market is still as unpredicatable as ever so one need not believe every voice of doom that bubbles up.','',396,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/05/31/396-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0);

In the past 10 years, using yoy% (year-over-year) monthly return data from 1/2003-12/2012, the DJ-UBS CI has had correlation of 0.64 to CPI yoy Index and the S&amp;P GSCI has had correlation of 0.74 to CPI yoy Index.

This concept is called inflation beta. Historically from 1992-2012 for every 1% increase in CPI, the S&amp;P GSCI has had a 16.0% increase and the DJ-UBS CI has had a 10.2% increase.

When rates are stable, whether high or low, the equity market is priced to reflect their stability. When rates change, the equity market adjusts to reflect the change. As with many other phenomena in economics (e.g., see http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/1970%202/1970b_bpea_branson_krause_kareken_salant.pdf), it\'s not the level of a variable that makes the difference, but the variable\'s rate of change.\r\n\r\nStable rates, other things equal, enhance the stability of equity returns. Rising rates, if indeed they do continue to rise, may present a continuing challenge.','',694,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/06/23/694-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0);

Rising volatility typically means lower stock prices -- the correlation of the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index was -0.78. If volatility continues to rise, what can equity investors do to diminish its impact?\r\n\r\nAn increasingly popular solution in recent years has been to use a variety of <a href=\"http://www.us.spindices.com/documents/research/low-volatility-effect-comprehensive-look-201208.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">low volatility </a>strategies as an alternative to traditional cap-weighted indices. Low vol indices are designed to attenuate the movements of their parent index, in both directions -- they typically go up less when times are good, and go down less when times are bad. But although they may go down less when times are bad, they still go <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/06/07/low-volatility-success-or-failure\" target=\"_blank\">down</a>. For the month of June (through the close on Friday 6/21), the total return of the S&amp;P 500 was -2.23%, versus -1.38% for the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility Index. Low Vol did what it typically does in bad markets by diminishing the parent index\'s decline.*\r\n\r\nThere\'s another approach to dealing with increasingly volatile equity markets. That approach is to own a long position in VIX futures -- in other words, to regard volatility as a diversifying asset for the investor\'s equity portfolio. In this sense, volatility is analogous to an insurance policy. The problem is that when you don\'t need it, volatility can be very expensive insurance. For the year ended 6/21/13, e.g., the S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index declined by -69% (while the S&amp;P 500 rose by +23%).* Holding a permanent or static portfolio weight in volatility is likely to be an expensive exercise.\r\n\r\nThe S&amp;P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Index attempts to cheapen the implicit insurance cost of owning volatility by altering its relative exposure to VIX and the underlying S&amp;P 500. (Hence the name: VEQTOR = Volatility and EQuity allocaTOR.) When it appears propitious to increase exposure to volatility (for example, when it\'s in an uptrend), VEQTOR holds more. At other times, VEQTOR\'s vol exposures can be quite modest. The combination of two negatively-correlated asset (equity and equity volatility) can produce a smoother, hedged pattern of returns, especially in comparison to a fully-invested equity index. For example, for the month of June (through the close on Friday 6/21), the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Index was +0.24%, compared to the S&amp;P 500\'s -2.23% decline.*\r\n\r\nVolatility is uncomfortable for all equity investors. But it\'s also unavoidable. Those who seek to lessen its effects can try to own it (with VEQTOR) or reduce it (with Low Vol). Both choices have their risks, and both have their potential rewards.\r\n\r\n* Examples are provided for illustrative purposes only.

And 45% said they have invested a \'significant portion\' in such funds.\"\r\n\r\nOne source of the rising popularity of index investing, even among active fund managers, is the growth in strategy indices offering a wide range of investment strategies through ETFs.  While market cap weighted index funds based on the S&amp;P 500 and other recognized indices continue to dominate the market, new ideas generate interest and attract assets.  A second reason for the growth of index investing is the fee differentials between passive and active management which favors passive investing.  Burton Malkiel who started the rush to passive investing with his book <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street </em> surveyed the field in a recent article in the <a href=\"http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.27.2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Journal of Economic Perspectives.</em></a>','',718,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/06/24/718-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0);

In the late 1970s inflation was well into double digits at 12% to 15%.  Though interest rates were rising, they were not quite keeping up with inflation so the real (inflation adjusted) cost of money was low and investors  rushed to buy houses and hard assets.  Despite repeated government efforts, inflation -- and the damage it wrought on the economy -- seemed unstoppable.  Paul Volcker, the newly appointed Fed chairman, led a sharp shift in Fed policy in October, 1979 which drove interest rates sky high, sent the economy into two back-to-back recessions and knocked inflation out.  Inflation dropped from 14.8% in March, 1980 to 2.6% in June, 1983.  The bank prime rate -- the analogy to Libor today -- peaked at 21% and in November of 1981 the Treasury sold 30 year bonds with a 14% coupon which out-performed the S&amp;P 500 the next  year as bond yields collapsed  So much for ancient history.\r\n\r\nThe turmoil in 1979-81 whipped inflation and sparked the bond rally that either ended last week or, hopefully, is still with us. The chart shows how long it has run and how far yields have dropped -- from 14% to 2%.  The legacy the rally is more than last week\'s low yields; it is the almost complete absence of inflation.  Unlike the 1970s and early 1980s, investors don\'t have to constantly worry about inflation eating into their wealth or pushing bonds yields up and bond prices down.  The result is a fixed income market that responds to monetary policy and credit conditions, allowing investors to both gauge the attractiveness and hopefully profit from different fixed income assest classes. Who would look at municipal bonds were inflation at 8%, 10% or 12%.  There is no guarantee that inflation will remain low into the future, but if investors recognize the benefits of keeping price increases in control, the odds are that the Fed and others will hold inflation in check.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bond rally may, or may not, be fading, but its legacy of low inflation is with us to the benefit of fixed income investing.','',0,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/?p=735',0,'post','',0);

I must admit I was very excited watching the most amazing finish I have ever seen in hockey, but as a commodity lady my first thought was about the metal in the Stanley Cup and what is it worth, especially given the current environment of a strengthening U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond yields.\r\n\r\nFrom the economic backdrop, silver and nickel, the two metals that form the cup, are the worst performing metals in their respective sectors. Year-to-date in 2013, the S&amp;P GSCI Silver is down 35.8% and the S&amp;P GSCI Nickel lost 20.8%. The cup is made up of 97% silver and 3% nickel, so just for fun, we thought we would chart a \"Stanley Cup Index\" to reflect historical levels of the alloy.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_728\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stanley-Cup-Index.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-728\" alt=\"Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

The \"Stanley Cup Index\" is computed using 3% of the S&amp;P GSCI Nickel Total Return and 97% Silver Total Return index levels. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.[/caption]\r\n\r\nWho won the most valuable Stanley Cup? The last time the Chicago Blackhawks took the title, the cup had about the same value as yesterday, only slightly higher at 213<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\"> versus yesterday\'s level of 205. However, while they were holding it, the index increased 153% to a high value of 538 on April 29, 2011 - just before the Boston Bruins would take it over but at a value 27% off the high at an index level of 391.  </span>\r\n\r\nAlthough our hypothetical \"Stanley Cup Index\" only begins 20 years ago, as far back as we have the single commodity index data for nickel, there was a time where the cup was worth more. To illustrate roughly the cup in history as far back as 1927, the first time the Cup was solely contested by National Hockey League teams, one can look at the <a href=\"http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/gold-and-silver-prices-100-year-historical-chart\" target=\"_blank\">historical silver prices</a> on an inflation adjusted basis.  The approximate value of the original cup (100% sliver,) the historical price can be multiplied by the weight of 459.74 troy oz. According to this method, for example, yesterday the price was roughly $19.50 so the value of the cup was about $8,964.93. According to the chart, in 1979, when the Montreal Canadiens won, the value was approximately $12,307.24 and rose to a value of about $47,256.67 by Jan 1980. Not unlike the 2010-11 drop before the Bruins last won, the value of the cup dropped 55% to roughly $21,106.66 before the New York Islanders earned it.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Historical-SILVER-Prices.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-727\" alt=\"Historical real (inflation-adjusted)  silver prices back to 1915.

However, the rising popularity of ETFs have boosted the share of assets in passive or index-based investments.  Now comes a report that more and more investors -- including active managers -- are investing in passive or index-based investments.  <em>FTFM </em>reports that a \"survey of 1001 fund management professionals -- many of whom make their living promoting active products -- showed that two-thirds have invested a sizeable amount of their personal savings in passive products. And 45% said they have invested a \'significant portion\' in such funds.\"\r\n\r\nOne source of the rising popularity of index investing, even among active fund managers, is the growth in strategy indices offering a wide range of investment strategies through ETFs.  While market cap weighted index funds based on the S&amp;P 500 and other recognized indices continue to dominate the market, new ideas generate interest and attract assets.  A second reason for the growth of index investing is the fee differentials between passive and active management which favors passive investing.  Burton Malkiel who started the rush to passive investing with his book <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street </em> surveyed the field in a recent article in the <a href=\"http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.27.2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Journal of Economic Perspectives.</em></a>','',718,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/06/24/718-revision-5/',0,'revision','',0);

If the Fed is too optimistic and the economy falters, we will see QE4; but, we might be too nervous to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nWhere can one hide?\r\n\r\nNot bonds, maybe stocks. Maybe the silver lining is we’ve seen the first tiny steps to being able to earn a (small) return on cash.\r\n\r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\nEveryone knew that one day the Fed would end Quantitative Easing but  everyone believed that that day would never come.  Then the Fed suggested a date – beginning of the end this fall, the end of the end next summer.  If your ten year treasury is worth 100 today and will be worth 90 next summer, you don’t wait  to sell it.  You sell it now and all that selling makes it worth 90 now. This is what happened.  Rather than complaining about the fickle Fed, remember their job is to worry about what could go wrong, lean against the wind and act as “the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed when the party was really warming up.” (The quote is from William McC. Martin, Fed chairman in the 1950s and 1960s, credit to the <a href=\"http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Conversable Economist blog</a> for the citation and a copy of the speech.)\r\n\r\nScorecard:\r\n\r\nS&amp;P 500 down 4.7% and DJIA down 4.3% from the close on Tuesday 6/18 to the close on Monday 6/24. 10 year Treasury note yield rose 38 bp or 17% over same time period.','',714,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/06/24/714-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0);

The stock market is down but has only retraced its steps back to late April or early May.\r\n\r\nConsensus outlook for the Fed is reductions in QE3 bond buying beginning in the fall and the complete end to QE3 sometime next summer.  Interest rates are expected to rise, but there is little agreement as to how much.  The Fed’s upbeat forecast for the economy of 3%-3.5% GDP growth in 2014 with continued low inflation is seen as a bit optimistic.\r\n\r\nAnd now…\r\n\r\nFirst, just because the Fed chairman Bernanke spent Wednesday afternoon explaining what the Fed expects and what it is likely to do, don’t believe it is locked-in or committed to a time table.  The Fed can, and frequently does, change its plans if the economy and markets change. One line many economists attribute to John Maynard Keynes is, “when the data change, I change my mind; what do you do?”  Whether or not the Fed economists are Keynesians, they do change their minds when the data change.\r\n\r\nSecond, if the Fed’s forecast turns out to be right – stronger growth, no inflation and less unemployment – the stock market’s prospects should look a whole lot better than in the last few days.  The market can advance when interest rates are rising, especially of the cause of rising rates is faster economic growth.\r\n\r\nThird, not only is the rest of the world watching, and worrying, about the Fed; the Fed is also watching the rest of the world.  One wild card may be China where there are lots of signs that economic growth is slowing and short term interest rates spiked earlier this week.  Were Chinese economic growth to falter we would hear renewed concerns about the economy and speculation about continued quantitative easing.\r\n\r\n<em>Source: Data for the chart are daily data from 12/31/2012 to 6/21/2013 as of 6/21/2013. 10-year Treasury yield is from Bloomberg, S&amp;P 500 is from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

Stocks responded with a sharp slide. Just as it seemed that all were united in castigating the Fed for bringing on the inevitable end to bond bull market, a counter attack was launched.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">In the week and a half since the press conference, the Fed has put on a full court press with <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/whatsnew.htm\" target=\"_blank\">speeches </a>from two Fed Governors and timely news stories pitching the idea that the rate rise was a case of premature market jitters. Why did rates rise? Some of the comments in Bernanke’s press conference reminded everyone that sooner or later QE3 would end and that, if the Fed’s economic forecast proved reasonably correct there would be no QE4.  While no one wanted to be reminded that QE3 would end; there were other factors in the press conference and the market.  Bernanke talked about beginning to taper off QE3 if the unemployment rate slipped into the neighborhood of 7%.  Some may have confused this with comments from a few months ago that the Fed Funds target would remain zero to 25 bp until the unemployment rate reached 6.5% . (It is 7.6%, at least until the next report on Friday morning). The Fed has two unemployment rate targets – one for QE3 and another for the Fed Funds rate.</span>\r\n\r\nMore important than the double unemployment rate targets, the Fed confirmed both in the press conference and in those recent speeches that monetary policy will respond to the economy and that it believes the economy is beginning to improve.  The Fed’s own forecast for 2014 looks almost rosy at 3% to 3.5% real growth, at or above trend.  That growth, rather than monetary policy, will boost interest rates.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who dun it</strong>? The number one suspect is the economy.

But, if over time it comes to substantially violate some of the guidelines, the Index Committee may decide that another company would be a better fit in the index. The requirement of U.S. companies is one which led to lots of discussion in recent years. There was a time when a company’s legal incorporation was the only factor determining its nationality.  Today with global corporations incorporated in one country, traded in another and earning revenues and profits in all over the world, deciding the nationality, or domicile, isn’t easy.  From discussions with investors and advisors, the most important factors for nationality are the stock’s primary listing, which country’s laws and which exchange’s rules govern its financial reporting, where its operations and headquarters are located and where it is incorporated.  While some companies in the S&amp;P 500 are incorporated outside the US, their primary exchange is either the NYSE or NASDAQ. All companies in the S&amp;P 500 report to the SEC as a US company.\r\n\r\nThe basis for the size, liquidity, and public float guidelines is well understood.  Part of assuring that the index represents the market is keeping the balance of sectors in the index close to the balance in the market.  If the weight of one sector in the index is much less than its weight in the overall market, the Index Committee may try to adjust sector balance through the next stock chosen.  However, the myth that the chosen stock is always in the same sector as the one it replaces is not true.  On one hand, the existence of a few large stocks that don’t meet the guidelines means that the sector balance will never be exact while on the other sector balance will always be fairly close because the S&amp;P 500 includes about 80% of the total market value.\r\n\r\nApplying these guidelines to companies not currently in the S&amp;P 500 yields a list of several candidates for the S&amp;P 500.  The selection is made by the Index Committee. In addition to sector balance, other factors considered in the selection are the event (acquisition, merger, bankruptcy, etc.) forcing the removal of a company, the size of the companies being dropped and added and announced future corporate actions.  In all these decisions, the objective is to assure that the S&amp;P 500 continues to represent the large cap US equity markets while keeping turnover and trading low.\r\n\r\nMore information about the index can be found on <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Dow Jones web site</a>.','',0,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/?p=827',0,'post','',5);

Notice prior to August 2004, the number of months spent in backwardation and contango were split 50%/50% and were mostly cyclical. Between Aug 2004 and May 2011, the environment was different and there were 79 of 82 months in contango, reflecting a time of excess inventory from the rush to supply closely followed by the demand destruction of the global financial crisis. Post May 2011, 1/3 of months have been in backwardation with 3 months occurring in 2011, 5 months in 2012 and 2 in 2013 (May and June).</span>\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean? If <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714\">there is a shift in environment going forward towards a world driven by expansion of demand, then backwardation may be more likely with more frequent cycle switching.

The double-digit equity gains of 2012 were no match for the artificially low interest rates which vaulted pension liabilities into record underfunding territory. Companies have only 77 cents for each dollar they owe in pensions and only 22 cents for each dollar of OPEB obligations. Overall, pensions and OPEB remain a manageable expense, currently within income and assets levels. Pensions funding should improve since interest rates have risen -&gt; the higher the interest rate used the lower the discounted liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe full report, \"S&amp;P 500 2012 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB): The Final Frontier\", can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.spdji.com/sp500\">www.spdji.com/sp500.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Defined pensions</b> underfunding set a new record at $451.7B in 2012, up $97B billion from $354.7B in 2011 (up $206.7B from $245B in 2010). The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.41% and the S&amp;P Global BMI ex-U.S. added 14.05%, but it’s what you owe more than what you have. Pension funding rate decreased to 77.3% from 78.8% in 2011 (83.9% in 2010). Pension return rates declined for the 12th consecutive year, to 7.31% from 7.60% in 2011 (7.73% in 2010). Discount rates declined for the fourth year in a row, falling 78 bps to 3.93% from 4.71% in 2011 (5.31% in 2010), significantly increasing projected obligations.\r\n\r\nFunds maintained 2011 allocations in 2012 in an attempt to manage forward risk from markets. Equity allocations ticked up to 48.6% from 48.4%. Fixed income allocations ticked down to 40.4% from 40.9%.\r\n\r\n<b>OPEB</b> underfunded increased to $234.9B from $223.4B in 2011 ($210.1B in 2010). Funding rate increased to 22.3% from 21.8%. OPEB remains a target for cuts. Medical coverage is now a political as well as social issue.\r\n\r\n<b>Combined</b>, S&amp;P 500 companies have set aside $1.60 trillion in pensions &amp; OPEB funds to cover $2.29 trillion in obligations,  with the resulting underfunding equating to $686.6B, or a 70.0% overall funding rate.\r\n\r\nCompanies continue to shift retirement risk to the individual. The good news for current retirees is that most S&amp;P 500 large-cap issues have enough cash and resources available to cover the expense. The bad news is for future retirees, whose benefits have been reduced or cut and will need to find a way to supplement, or postpone their retirement. <b>The American dream</b> of a golden retirement for baby boomers has dissipated for most.\r\n\r\nLegacy pension and OPEB programs will mostly work their way out of the last bastions of the U.S. labor market over the next several decades. For baby-boomers it is already too late to safely build-up assets, outside of working longer or living more frugally in retirement. For younger workers, there is a need to start early, permitting time to compound their returns for their retirement. <b>For individuals</b>, the personal wealth depletion, via lower housing and equity positions, combined with lower pension and OPEB benefits (as longevity and the cost of staying healthy continue to escalate), has left potential retirees with little ability to retire.

Why did rates rise? Some of the comments in Bernanke’s press conference reminded everyone that sooner or later QE3 would end and that, if the Fed’s economic forecast proved reasonably correct there would be no QE4.  While no one wanted to be reminded that QE3 would end; there were other factors in the press conference and the market.  Bernanke talked about beginning to taper off QE3 if the unemployment rate slipped into the neighborhood of 7%.  Some may have confused this with comments from a few months ago that the Fed Funds target would remain zero to 25 bp until the unemployment rate reached 6.5% . (It is 7.6%, at least until the next report on Friday morning). The Fed has two unemployment rate targets – one for QE3 and another for the Fed Funds rate.</span>\n\nMore important than the double unemployment rate targets, the Fed confirmed both in the press conference and in those recent speeches that monetary policy will respond to the economy and that it believes the economy is beginning to improve.  The Fed’s own forecast for 2014 looks almost rosy at 3% to 3.5% real growth, at or above trend.  That growth, rather than monetary policy, will boost interest rates.\n\n<strong>Who dun it</strong>?

While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.\r\n\r\nSince 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don\'t necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">“alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb”</a>.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months.

This month it is up 8.5% so if the rally looks like last time, there may be about 30% left, but that is only if the rally this time follows the symmetry of history. Another possibility is that gold could fall another 30% and have a loss like in the 1980-82 period.\r\n\r\nWhat prompted the interview on July 22 was the biggest one day move of gold since June 29, 2012. See the Q&amp;A below for the <strong>OTHER GOLDEN QUESTIONS</strong>:\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">1. <em>Gold reached a one month high earlier today – it was the biggest 1-day rally in over a year.

The demand for gold as a safe haven may have disappeared after that announcement.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">3. <em>And - what’s behind the 10% rebound this month?</em> </span>The rebound is on the fundamental story of expanding reserves from the banks, whether it’s the Fed, ECB or Bank of Japan, the demand is picking up while the ETF selloff seems to have eased.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_953\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"393\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-953\" alt=\"Source: Blackrock.

While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.\r\n\r\nSince 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don\'t necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">“alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb”</a>.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months. For them, alternative beta that <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">modified rolls</a> or <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weights</a> may have seemed to be the smarter solution since backwardation was a thing of the past. However, today that wisdom may not hold true because w</span>hile the <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\">persistence of backwardation</a> hasn\'t been seen since prior to 2005, backwardation (as measured by the difference between the excess return and price return versions of the  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a>), appeared in 5 months in 2012 an has now continued this year since May.\r\n\r\nThere is a noticeable shift of world growth that may be causing backwardation to reappear. A number of <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/article/coming-new-world-order-revolution-how-things-will-change-next-20-years-kondratieff-cycle-per\" target=\"_blank\">characteristics of world growth</a> driven by expansion of demand are becoming more widespread by the move from world growth driven by expansion of supply.  These factors are getting stronger since last year and they may drive the frequency and magnitude of cycles higher that may increase the incidence of switching between contango and backwardation.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/NWO%201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1045\" alt=\"New World\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New-World.jpg\" width=\"1065\" height=\"','',1038,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/06/1038-revision-39/',0,'revision','',0);

Health care was the biggest contributor providing 0.90 percentage points of the 4.95 points the index gained. Financials, which is a larger share of the index (16.7% vs. 12.7% for health care) contributed less to the total performance because it lagged health care\'s results.  Fortunately for investors, telecommunication services has a low weight since it was the one sector that slipped on the month.  Since the sector weights in the index are reasonably close to the sector weights for the overall market, looking at the weights can also give some hints to how the market might react.  Materials are 3.3% of the index and gold is in the materials sector -- gold\'s dramatic rise and fall in recent years was not a major factor in the overall stock market,\r\n\r\nOne can do the same analysis on a stock by stock basis.  Rather than list all 500 stocks, we can look at just the best and worst, measuring the impact in index points instead of pecentage points of price change. The biggest contributor in July was also one of the biggest stocks, Apple, which saw its stock rise 59 points to 452.5 and added 6.2 index points of the total 72.5 index point gain the S&amp;P 500 index enjoyed. At the other end of the list was Microsoft, which lost 2.8 points to close at 31.83 and subtracted 2.4 index points from the S&amp;P 500.  These are two of the larger stocks in the index, so it shouldn\'t be a surprise that they were at the extremes of adding, or removing performance from the overall index.\r\n\r\nThe same analysis can be done with any division of the S&amp;P 500, or any other index providing one can calculate both weights and performance. Is it more buyers than sellers? No, it\'s what they\'re buying or selling and how big the things being bought and sold are when compared to the index or the market.','',0,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/?p=1106',0,'post','',0);

Or, if the results were less appealing, why did it fall?  Either way the usual answer of more buyers than sellers is no answer at all.  The real question is what sectors pushed the market higher or which stocks sent it down.  A little arithmetic with the S&amp;P 500 can go a long way to understanding what is behind a market movement.\r\n\r\nLet\'s look at July 2013 as an example when the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.95% from June 30th to July 31st before adjusting for dividends.  The contribution of a sector or stock to the overall performance of the index is the weight of the sector or stock at the beginning of the month multiplied by the percentage price increase of that sector or stock.  The table shows the calculations for July:\r\n<table width=\"569\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><col width=\"200\" /> <col span=\"2\" width=\"141\" /> <col width=\"87\" />\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"200\" height=\"20\">Index/Sector</td>\r\n<td width=\"141\">Performance</td>\r\n<td width=\"141\">Share (6-30-13)</td>\r\n<td width=\"87\">Contribution</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\">S&amp;P 500</td>\r\n<td>4.95%</td>\r\n<td>100.0%</td>\r\n<td>4.95%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Utilities</td>\r\n<td>4.2%</td>\r\n<td>3.3%</td>\r\n<td>0.14</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Telecommunication Services</td>\r\n<td>-0.7%</td>\r\n<td>2.8%</td>\r\n<td>-0.02</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Information Technology</td>\r\n<td>4.1%</td>\r\n<td>17.8%</td>\r\n<td>0.73</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Financials</td>\r\n<td>5.3%</td>\r\n<td>16.7%</td>\r\n<td>0.88</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Health Care</td>\r\n<td>7.1%</td>\r\n<td>12.7%</td>\r\n<td>0.90</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Consumer Staples</td>\r\n<td>3.9%</td>\r\n<td>10.5%</td>\r\n<td>0.41</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Consumer Discretionary</td>\r\n<td>5.1%</td>\r\n<td>12.2%</td>\r\n<td>0.63</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Industrials</td>\r\n<td>5.6%</td>\r\n<td>10.2%</td>\r\n<td>0.57</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"20\"> Materials</td>\r\n<td>5.5%</td>\r\n<td>3.3%</td>\r\n<td>0.18</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" height=\"20\"> Energy</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">5.0%</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">10.5%</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">0.53</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\nThe contribution of a sector depends on both the weight or share and on its performance. Health care was the biggest contributor providing 0.90 percentage points of the 4.95 points the index gained. Financials, which is a larger share of the index (16.7% vs. 12.7% for health care) contributed less to the total performance because it lagged health care\'s results.  Fortunately for investors, telecommunication services has a low weight since it was the one sector that slipped on the month.  Since the sector weights in the index are reasonably close to the sector weights for the overall market, looking at the weights can also give some hints to how the market might react.  Materials are 3.3% of the index and gold is in the materials sector -- gold\'s dramatic rise and fall in recent years was not a major factor in the overall stock market,\r\n\r\nOne can do the same analysis on a stock by stock basis.  Rather than list all 500 stocks, we can look at just the best and worst, measuring the impact in index points instead of pecentage points of price change. The biggest contributor in July was also one of the biggest stocks, Apple which saw its stock rise 59 points to 452.5 and added 6.2 index points of the total 72.5 index point gain the S&amp;P 500 index enjoyed. At the other end of the list was Microsoft which lost 2.8 points to close at 31.83 and subtracted 2.4 index points from the S&amp;P 500.  These are two of the larger stocks in the index, so it shouldn\'t be a surprise that they were at the extremes of adding, or removing, performance from the overall index.\r\n\r\nThe same analysis can be done with any division of the S&amp;P 500, or any other index providing one can calculate both weights and performance. Is it more buyers than sellers? No, its what they\'re buying or selling and how big the things being bought and sold are when compared to the index or the market.','',1106,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/07/1106-revision-6/',0,'revision','',0);

While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.\r\n\r\nSince 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don\'t necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">“alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb”</a>.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months.

However, today that wisdom may not hold true because w</span>hile the <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\">persistence of backwardation</a> hasn\'t been seen since prior to 2005, backwardation (as measured by the difference between the excess return and price return versions of the  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a>), appeared in 5 months in 2012 an has now continued this year since May.\r\n\r\nThere is a noticeable shift of world growth that may be causing backwardation to reappear.

While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.\r\n\r\nSince 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don\'t necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">“alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb”</a>.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months. For them, alternative beta that <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">modified rolls</a> or <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weights</a> may have seemed to be the smarter solution since backwardation was a thing of the past. However, today that wisdom may not hold true because w</span>hile the <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\">persistence of backwardation</a> hasn\'t been seen since prior to 2005, backwardation (as measured by the difference between the excess return and price return versions of the  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a>), appeared in 5 months in 2012 an has now continued this year since May.\r\n\r\nThere is a noticeable shift of world growth that may be causing backwardation to reappear. A number of <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/article/coming-new-world-order-revolution-how-things-will-change-next-20-years-kondratieff-cycle-per\" target=\"_blank\">characteristics of world growth</a> driven by expansion of demand are becoming more widespread by the move from world growth driven by expansion of supply.  These factors are getting stronger since last year and they may drive the frequency and magnitude of cycles higher that may increase the incidence of switching between contango and backwardation.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/NWO%201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1045\" alt=\"New World\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New-World.jpg\" width=\"1065\" heigh','',1038,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/07/1038-revision-41/',0,'revision','',0);

As we enter the second full week of August – or the third week before Labor Day for the pessimists and workaholics – things seem to be going quiet.  The Dell buyout, just about the only contested M&amp;A action, is postponed until next month. Trading volumes are down, VIX is in the low teens or less, and even the European debt problems seem to be on vacation with most of the continent. Lest we all go to sleep, a few reminders about things to come and where we are now may be in order.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/your-money/this-ironman-market-is-still-lacking-respect.html?ref=business&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> noted that the S&amp;P 500 is on a strong streak – it started in 2012 and 2013 with first day gains and hasn’t revisited those starting points since in a demonstration of staying power. Actually the bull market began on March 9<sup>th</sup> 2009 with the S&amp;P 500 at 676.53 about 56 months ago. On Friday August 9<sup>th</sup> the index closed at 1691.42, a rise of 150%.  This is a touch below the average bull market gain of 163%; the average life for a bull market is 56 month.  By either measure we could keep going for quite some time; but also by either measure an end in the near future wouldn’t look unusual compared to history.  There are two places to look for possible answers to the question of what might happen next to the market.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">First, returns depend on three interrelated factors: earnings growth, PE expansion and dividends.  Most analysts expect continued earnings growth; the dividend yield at 2% currently is a small positive while the PE at 17x on trailing earnings is a bit high but not frightening.  All this suggests that most investors should feel comfortable during this August vacation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">The second answer to what might happen to upset the apple cart? Several things: sooner or later the Fed will shift policy, QE3 will fade out and interest rates will rise. Those who doubt this matters should remember May and June this year.  That experience showed that the damage can come quickly and at any hint of a shift at the central bank.  Sometime this fall the President will nominate a new Fed chairman.  Either of the two most discussed candidates – Janet Yellin and Larry Summers – is qualified for the job.  But changing the leadership in any organization means slower decision making, shifting people and positions and readjustments. It raises the risks that things don’t run as smoothly as we’re accustomed to.  Besides the Fed there is fiscal policy -- either Congress will raise the debt ceiling in the next few months or the US government will default.

At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk gets passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.\r\n\r\nLet\'s address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX - commodity link. Please see below for the chart of fundamental sources and components of commodity returns and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXbnyL7L-E&amp;list=TLtf5reSX02bw\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> to hear more about them in an educational slideshow.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-Commodity-Return-Sources.jpg\" alt=\"5 Commodity Return Sources\" width=\"623\" height=\"409\" />\r\n\r\nThe insurance risk premium is available to long-only commodity investors since there is a gap that needs to be filled between producers and commercial consumers that are hedging. Remember, the futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against price drops and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks\' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes\' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward price pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.  This results in net short hedging pressure from physical users as shown in the graph below:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1297\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hedging-Pressure.jpg\" alt=\"Hedging Pressure\" width=\"493\" height=\"372\" />\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the second question, \"At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato?\"\r\n\r\nAs published in a <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper by Cheng et al.</a>, while in normal times, or in other words \"pre-crisis\", commodity investors accommodate the needs of commercial producers by providing the aforementioned insurance by taking the long side of the futures contracts that the commercial consumers forego. However, in times of financial distress, or \"post-crisis\",  commodity investors reduce their net long positions in response to an increase in the risk as measured by VIX, causing the risk to flow back to the hedgers.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening, as <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/commodity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tang and Xiong argue</a>, is that although the risk sharing improves as the presence of commodity index traders increases, the expense of risk spillover from outside markets increases.  Simply stated, the risk for investors to provide insurance becomes too high to bear. Like the convection of a current of air that flows from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the risk flows from the more distressed commodity index investors to the less distressed hedgers - beginning the game of \"hot potato\" since no one wants to hold the risk. The result is a collapse in <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp\" target=\"_blank\">open interest</a> as shown in <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Cheng\'s paper</a> in the table below.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1301\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VIX-Commodity-Open-Interest.jpg\" alt=\"VIX Commodity Open Interest\" width=\"602\" height=\"390\" />\r\n\r\nHow does this translate into linking VIX spikes to commodity dips? Using weekly return data on a rolling basis daily back to January 1990, of a total of 215 times that VIX spiked more than 20%, 142 occurred prior to Sept 2008 and 73 occurred after Sept 2008. In the pre-crisis, of the 142 times that VIX spiked &gt;20%, commodities fell 82 times or 58% of the time with an average return of 6 basis points during the weeks of VIX spikes. However, the post crisis number of weeks on a rolling basis where VIX spiked &gt;20% was 73 and commodity returns were negative 65 of those times or 89% with an average return of -3.4%.

The Dow was created by Dow Jones &amp; Company, the published of the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>and is now owned and maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.  It is price-weighted meaning that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the 30 stocks and dividing by the divisor. The divisor is used to prevent the index from changing when the stocks are changed. With price weighting, the highest price stock, IBM carries about 23 times more weight in the index than the lowest price stock, Alcoa.  In fact, IBM has twice as much weight and a bigger impact on the index than ExxonMobil even though ExxonMobil is almost twice as large as IBM measured by market value.\r\n\r\nThe S&amp;P 500 is a relative new comer.  It took its present form of 500 stocks in 1957 when the Standard Statistics 90 Stock Index, created in 1926, became the S&amp;P 500.  The 500 is value-weighted (sometimes called cap-weighted).  The market value of all 500 companies is totaled and divided by a divisor. The divisor serves the same function for the 500 as it does for the Dow, preventing jumps when stocks are replaced. Since not every share of every stock is readily available in the market – some shares are closely held and rarely traded – the index is float adjusted to exclude closely held shares. Each company’s weight in the index is proportional to its size.  For instance, ExxonMobil’s weight will be twice that of IBM in the S&amp;P 500 unlike the price-weighted DJIA.  Because of the different weighting methods and the much larger number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 than the DJIA, the range from largest to smallest company, or highest to lowest price, is much greater for the S&amp;P 500.  The larger number of stocks in the 500 also makes it possible to divide the index and compare the performance of different parts of the market using sectors (technology, utilities, health care, financials, etc.) or styles (growth and value). Further, because the market is value weighted, the returns and volatilities measured with the S&amp;P 500 give returns and volatility for the market.\r\n\r\nOverall both indices are widely followed and both are used to analyze and predict the market and to invest or manage risk through investment products based on the indices.','',0,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/?p=1195',0,'post','',0);

On Friday August 9<sup>th</sup> the index closed at 1691.42, a rise of 150%.  This is a touch below the average bull market gain of 163%; the average life for a bull market is 56 month.  By either measure we could keep going for quite some time; but also by either measure an end in the near future wouldn’t look unusual compared to history.  There are two places to look for possible answers to the question of what might happen next to the market.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">First, returns depend on three interrelated factors: earnings growth, PE expansion and dividends.  Most analysts expect continued earnings growth; the dividend yield at 2% currently is a small positive while the PE at 17x on trailing earnings is a bit high but not frightening.  All this suggests that most investors should feel comfortable during this August vacation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">The second answer to what might happen to upset the apple cart? Several things: sooner or later the Fed will shift policy, QE3 will fade out and interest rates will rise. Those who doubt this matters should remember May and June this year.  That experience showed that the damage can come quickly and at any hint of a shift at the central bank.  Sometime this fall the President will nominate a new Fed chairman.  Either of the two most discussed candidates – Janet Yellin and Larry Summers – is qualified for the job.  But changing the leadership in any organization means slower decision making, shifting people and positions and readjustments. It raises the risks that things don’t run as smoothly as we’re accustomed to.  Besides the Fed there is fiscal policy -- either Congress will raise the debt ceiling in the next few months or the US government will default. The debt ceiling will be raised but probably not without a lot of politics and nervousness which won’t play very well in the markets or anywhere else. </span>\r\n\r\nWashington DC isn’t the only source of post-Labor Day market anxiety.  There’s a long list of slowing growth in China, those unresolved European debt crises, turmoil in Egypt, war in Syria, and nuclear issues in various countries.  For this bull market to beat the averages by a large margin we have a high wall of worry to climb.','',1165,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/11/1165-revision-6/',0,'revision','',0);

At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.\r\n\r\nLet\'s address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX - commodity link.

The producers go short to protect against a price drop and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks\' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes\' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.','',1179,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/13/1179-revision-10/',0,'revision','',0);

The top-line items are that foreign sales increased (46.6% from 46.1%), Asian sales continued to grow as European sales continued to decline, and S&amp;P 500 issues reversed their income tax payments and sent more to Washington in 2012 than they sent abroad (51.2% in 2012 compared to 45.3% in 2011). The bottom-line item, however, is taxes. There is battle brewing over who should pay what, and I believe that battle will emulate the health care debate, and be just as divisive. Corporations pay what is required, and if there is a legal way to reduce their payment, they will take it, and rightfully so (I feel). The issue is the rules, and that is where we should be focused on. Fairness, economic implications, and social policy all have a part in the rules.

Sector variance showed that mid- and small-cap issues had slightly higher concentration in Health Care and less in Information Technology and Finance. Top-line foreign sales exposure seems to reduce with size, but bottom-line income may be a different story.  Large-caps may be able to control more of their fate through ownership, joint ventures and the ability to hedge currencies to protect costs.  Smaller-caps appear to have to go with the flow more - so if they are currently importing component parts from Japan, they are saving a few cents.  I’ll put together a report later in the month.\n\n','',1261,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/14/1261-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0);

At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.\r\n\r\nLet\'s address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX - commodity link.

The producers go short to protect against a price drop and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks\' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes\' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.','',1179,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/14/1179-revision-11/',0,'revision','',0);

Our analysis shows that portfolio risk can be mitigated by diversifying across asset classes while meeting the specific investment objective, whether it’s income, inflation protection or balanced asset class risk exposure.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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','',1223,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/14/1223-revision-11/',0,'revision','',0);

The issue is the rules, and that is where we should be focused on. Fairness, economic implications, and social policy all have a part in the rules.

Asian sales are increasing, and just as relevant is the production which is done there and imported back to the U.S. The Heartland of America (manufacturing) is returning, with the question being how much can it grow given U.S. economic and social costs, as companies continue to cut-costs and have difficulties passing along higher costs. Retail issues show the impact quicker to foreign sales and currency, as consumers can quickly decide to change their spending habits (COH, TIF, MCD); decision for major purchases, such as equipment (CAT) can take months to decide or change.\r\n\r\nAn upturn after last year’s tick down, but Asia continues to increase as Europe continues to decrease.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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','',1261,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/14/1261-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0);

It would be nice to believe that when congress returns they will focus in on those issues, but with all due respect to my compliance people – I fear that past performance will be indicative of future returns.\r\n\r\n<strong>S&amp;P 500 sales:</strong>\r\nIn 2012, European sales declined to 9.7% of all S&amp;P 500 sales, down from 11.1% in 2011 and 13.5% in 2010\r\nU.K. representation declined to 1.7% from 2.4% in 2011\r\nEuropean ex-U.K. sales declined to 8.0%, from 8.7% in 2011 and 12.0% in 2010\r\nAsian sales increased to 7.5% of all sales, from 7.2% in 2011 and 6.1% in 2010\r\nCanadian sales declined to 4.1% of all sales from 4.3% in 2011\r\n\r\nInformation technology continued to be the most successful and exposed sector in terms of foreign sales, with 58.3% of its declared sales being foreign\r\nThe sector represents 16.2% of all U.S. foreign sales, down from 19.0% in 2011\r\n\r\nS&amp;P 500 companies reversed their payments and sent more money to Washington for income taxes than they did to foreign governments\r\nPayments to Washington increased 24.2% to $145.8 billion, as payments abroad declined 1.8% to $139.1 billion\r\n51.2% of declared income taxes were paid to the U.S. and 48.8% were paid to foreign governments\r\n\r\nA slight uptick in the companies reporting foreign sales data was noted, however, almost half of the S&amp;P 500 issues still do not report sufficient information to facilitate producing a complete report on global sales.\r\n\r\nFor the S&amp;P 500, 46.6% of all sales are estimated to have been produced and sold outside of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 46.1% in 2011 and 46.3% in 2010.\r\n\r\n<strong>Observation/Commentary:</strong>\r\nAt this point it is not just about tax rates and credits, but in what domain the sales and profits are registered in. <strong>Tax policy has now become a major issue with the public debate expected to grow substantially, emulating the levels and political turmoil which surrounded the health care debate.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile European sales are down, they are still a major component of U.S. sales, with their growth expectations having now been scaled back. Asian sales are increasing, and just as relevant is the production which is done there and imported back to the U.S. The Heartland of America (manufacturing) is returning, with the question being how much can it grow given U.S. economic and social costs, as companies continue to cut-costs and have difficulties passing along higher costs. Retail issues show the impact quicker to foreign sales and currency, as consumers can quickly decide to change their spending habits (COH, TIF, MCD); decision for major purchases, such as equipment (CAT) can take months to decide or change.\r\n\r\nAn upturn after last year’s tick down, but Asia continues to increase as Europe continues to decrease.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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','',1261,'https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/08/20/1261-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0);

Overall, pensions and OPEB remain a manageable expense, currently within income and assets levels. Pensions funding should improve since interest rates have risen -&gt; the higher the interest rate used the lower the discounted liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe full report, \"S&amp;P 500 2012 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB): The Final Frontier\", can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.spdji.com/sp500\">www.spdji.com/sp500.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Defined pensions</b> underfunding set a new record at $451.7B in 2012, up $97B billion from $354.7B in 2011 (up $206.7B from $245B in 2010). The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.41% and the S&amp;P Global BMI ex-U.S. added 14.05%, but it’s what you owe more than what you have. Pension funding rate decreased to 77.3% from 78.8% in 2011 (83.9% in 2010). Pension return rates declined for the 12th consecutive year, to 7.31% from 7.60% in 2011 (7.73% in 2010). Discount rates declined for the fourth year in a row, falling 78bps to 3.93% from 4.71% in 2011 (5.31% in 2010), significantly increasing projected obligations.\r\n\r\nFunds maintained 2011 allocations in 2012 in an attempt to manage forward risk from markets. Equity allocations ticked up to 48.6% from 48.4%. Fixed income allocations ticked down to 40.4% from 40.9%.\r\n\r\n<b>OPEB</b> underfunded increased to $234.9B from $223.4B in 2011 ($210.1B in 2010). Funding rate increased to 22.3% from 21.8%. OPEB remains a target for cuts. Medical coverage is now a political as well as social issue.\r\n\r\n<b>Combined</b>, S&amp;P 500 companies have set aside $1.60 trillion in pensions &amp; OPEB funds to cover $2.29 trillion in obligations,  with the resulting underfunding equating to $686.6B, or a 70.0% overall funding rate.\r\n\r\nCompanies continue to shift retirement risk to the individual. The good news for current retirees is that most S&amp;P 500 large-cap issues have enough cash and resources available to cover the expense. The bad news is for future retirees, whose benefits have been reduced or cut and will need to find a way to supplement, or postpone their retirement. <b>The American dream</b> of a golden retirement for baby boomers has dissipated for most.\r\n\r\nLegacy pension and OPEB programs will mostly work their way out of the last bastions of the U.S. labor market over the next several decades. For baby-boomers it is already too late to safely build-up assets, outside of working longer or living more frugally in retirement.

The double-digit equity gains of 2012 were no match for the artificially low interest rates which vaulted pension liabilities into record underfunding territory. Companies have only 77 cents for each dollar they owe in pensions and only 22 cents for each dollar of OPEB obligations. Overall, pensions and OPEB remain a manageable expense, currently within income and assets levels. Pensions funding should improve since interest rates have risen -&gt; the higher the interest rate used the lower the discounted liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe full report, \"S&amp;P 500 2012 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB): The Final Frontier\", can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.spdji.com/sp500\">www.spdji.com/sp500.</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Defined pensions</b> underfunding set a new record at $451.7B in 2012, up $97B billion from $354.7B in 2011 (up $206.7B from $245B in 2010). The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.41% and the S&amp;P Global BMI ex-U.S. added 14.05%, but it’s what you owe more than what you have. Pension funding rate decreased to 77.3% from 78.8% in 2011 (83.9% in 2010). Pension return rates declined for the 12th consecutive year, to 7.31% from 7.60% in 2011 (7.73% in 2010). Discount rates declined for the fourth year in a row, falling 78 bps to 3.93% from 4.71% in 2011 (5.31% in 2010), significantly increasing projected obligations.\r\n\r\nFunds maintained 2011 allocations in 2012 in an attempt to manage forward risk from markets. Equity allocations ticked up to 48.6% from 48.4%. Fixed income allocations ticked down to 40.4% from 40.9%.\r\n\r\n<b>OPEB</b> underfunded increased to $234.9B from $223.4B in 2011 ($210.1B in 2010). Funding rate increased to 22.3% from 21.8%. OPEB remains a target for cuts. Medical coverage is now a political as well as social issue.\r\n\r\n<b>Combined</b>, S&amp;P 500 companies have set aside $1.60 trillion in pensions &amp; OPEB funds to cover $2.29 trillion in obligations,  with the resulting underfunding equating to $686.6B, or a 70.0% overall funding rate.\r\n\r\nCompanies continue to shift retirement risk to the individual. The good news for current retirees is that most S&amp;P 500 large-cap issues have enough cash and resources available to cover the expense. The bad news is for future retirees, whose benefits have been reduced or cut and will need to find a way to supplement, or postpone their retirement. <b>The American dream</b> of a golden retirement for baby boomers has dissipated for most.\r\n\r\nLegacy pension and OPEB programs will mostly work their way out of the last bastions of the U.S. labor market over the next several decades. For baby-boomers it is already too late to safely build-up assets, outside of working longer or living more frugally in retirement. For younger workers, there is a need to start early, permitting time to compound their returns for their retirement. <b>For individuals</b>, the personal wealth depletion, via lower housing and equity positions, combined with lower pension and OPEB benefits (as longevity and the cost of staying healthy continue to escalate), has left potential retirees with little ability to retire.

Unfortunately for investors the curve steepening is likely to continue, even as yields on long duration investments have become attractive and the continuing increase in rates pushes prices downward. Sticking with short durations, or implementing a laddering strategy out to the middle of the curve, will help. As short bonds in the laddering strategy mature, the money can be reinvested at the long end of the ladder and capture higher yields in a rising rate environment, while the short end of the ladder stay consistent as long as the Fed keeps the front end near zero.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1535\" alt=\"Month-to-Date Yield Curve Shift 08-22-2013\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Month-to-Date-Yield-Curve-Shift-08-22-2013-442x279-custom.jpg\" width=\"442\" height=\"279\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1537\" alt=\"Fixed Income Return 08-21-2013\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fixed-Income-Return-08-21-2013.jpg\" width=\"910\" height=\"319\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSource:  S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices as of Aug. 21, 2013.
