The same cannot be said for the S&amp;P/ISDA CDS European Banks Select 15 Index whose spread widened by 35bps in tandem with the news of the banking crisis in Cyprus.Cypriot banks remained closed fo r a week while the general public waited in long lines to withdrawal a maximum of €300 per person, per day, per bank. It has been reported that the Bank of Cyprus may impose a loss of as much as 60% on accounts above €100,000 in holdings. The country's second largest bank, Cyprus Polular Bank will be split into a \"good\" and \"bad\" bank. The Cyprus government has a €l.L.j billion bond maturing in June [3.75% 6/3/2013] for which funds will be needed. European officials have been taking action to avoid any additional debt problems. To date there have been problems with Cyprus, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain which have all required bailouts.Constituents to the index such as Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banco Popolare widened by more than lOObps as their BBB- credit rating puts them right on the cusp of losing an investment grade rating. UniCredit bank paper rated 'BBB+' widened by an average of l.jlbps. Single 'A' rated and above issuer's spreads also widened t hough not as dramatic as the 'BBB' rated issuers. On average the 'double A' and 'single A' members of the S&amp;P/ISDA CDS European Banks Select 15 Index were 20bps wider and include some key European banking names such as: Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, BNP Pari bas, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Bank, Lloyds TSB Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and UBS.<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-146 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger.jpg\" alt=\"US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger\" width=\"638\" height=\"381\" /></a><a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SP_ISDA_CDS_EuroBanks_15_vs_US_Financials_10.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-147 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SP_ISDA_CDS_EuroBanks_15_vs_US_Financials_10.jpg\" alt=\"SP_ISDA_CDS_EuroBanks_15_vs_US_Financials_10\" width=\"725\" height=\"463\" /></a>&nbsp;"

		"post_content" : "The S&amp;P/ISDA CDS U.S. Financials Select 10 Index held steady widening by a diminutive amount [3bps] for the month of March. The same cannot be said for the S&amp;P/ISDA CDS European Banks Select 15 Index whose spread widened by 35bps in tandem with the news of the banking crisis in Cyprus.Cypriot banks remained closed fo r a week while the general public waited in long lines to withdrawal a maximum of €300 per person, per day, per bank. It has been reported that the Bank of Cyprus may impose a loss of as much as 60% on accounts above €100,000 in holdings. The country's second largest bank, Cyprus Polular Bank will be split into a \"good\" and \"bad\" bank. The Cyprus government has a €l.L.j billion bond maturing in June [3.75% 6/3/2013] for which funds will be needed. European officials have been taking action to avoid any additional debt problems. To date there have been problems with Cyprus, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain which have all required bailouts.Constituents to the index such as Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banco Popolare widened by more than lOObps as their BBB- credit rating puts them right on the cusp of losing an investment grade rating. UniCredit bank paper rated 'BBB+' widened by an average of l.jlbps. Single 'A' rated and above issuer's spreads also widened t hough not as dramatic as the 'BBB' rated issuers. On average the 'double A' and 'single A' members of the S&amp;P/ISDA CDS European Banks Select 15 Index were 20bps wider and include some key European banking names such as: Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, BNP Pari bas, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Bank, Lloyds TSB Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and UBS.<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-146 aligncenter\" alt=\"US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger.jpg\" width=\"638\" height=\"381\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;"

The bank card rate was 3.37% in February vs. 3.41% in January. The second mortgage and auto loan default rates increased in February posting 0.71% and 1.11%; they were marginally up from their respective 0.69% and 1.10% January levels.'Consumer credit quality remains healthy', says David M. Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. 'The first mortgage and bank card default rates moved down, the second mortgage and auto loans were marginally up in February.

The same cannot be said for the S&amp;P/ISDA CDS European Banks Select 15 Index whose spread widened by 35bps in tandem with the news of the banking crisis in Cyprus.Cypriot banks remained closed fo r a week while the general public waited in long lines to withdrawal a maximum of €300 per person, per day, per bank. It has been reported that the Bank of Cyprus may impose a loss of as much as 60% on accounts above €100,000 in holdings. The country's second largest bank, Cyprus Polular Bank will be split into a \"good\" and \"bad\" bank. The Cyprus government has a €l.L.j billion bond maturing in June [3.75% 6/3/2013] for which funds will be needed. European officials have been taking action to avoid any additional debt problems. To date there have been problems with Cyprus, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain which have all required bailouts.Constituents to the index such as Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banco Popolare widened by more than lOObps as their BBB- credit rating puts them right on the cusp of losing an investment grade rating. UniCredit bank paper rated 'BBB+' widened by an average of l.jlbps. Single 'A' rated and above issuer's spreads also widened t hough not as dramatic as the 'BBB' rated issuers. On average the 'double A' and 'single A' members of the S&amp;P/ISDA CDS European Banks Select 15 Index were 20bps wider and include some key European banking names such as: Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, BNP Pari bas, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Bank, Lloyds TSB Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and UBS.<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-146 aligncenter\" alt=\"US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US_V_European_Banks_CDS_Rieger.jpg\" width=\"638\" height=\"381\" /></a><a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SP_ISDA_CDS_EuroBanks_15_vs_US_Financials_10.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-147 aligncenter\" alt=\"SP_ISDA_CDS_EuroBanks_15_vs_US_Financials_10\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SP_ISDA_CDS_EuroBanks_15_vs_US_Financials_10.jpg\" width=\"725\" height=\"463\" /></a>&nbsp;"

The national composite was 1.55% in February, down from 1.63% in January.The first mortgage default rate moved down to 1.48% in February, from 1.58% in January. The bank card rate was 3.37% in February vs. 3.41% in January. The second mortgage and auto loan default rates increased in February posting 0.71% and 1.11%; they were marginally up from their respective 0.69% and 1.10% January levels.'Consumer credit quality remains healthy', says David M. Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. 'The first mortgage and bank card default rates moved down, the second mortgage and auto loans were marginally up in February. All loan types remain below their respective levels a year ago.'These trends are consistent with other economic news-improvements in employment and overall economic activity and continuing gains in housing. Additionally, foreclosure activity continues to decline even though it remains at elevated levels compared to the period before the financial crisis.'Three of the five cities we cover showed decreases in their default rates in February-New York was down by 12 basis points, Los Angeles by 18 and Miami by 24 basis points. Chicago was marginally up by one basis point and Dallas was up by seven basis points. Miami had the highest default rate at 3.21% and Dallas-the lowest at 1.26% among the five cities.

		"post_content" : "A recently published paper received a fair amount of publicity for its suggestion that portfolios selected randomly by monkeys would have outperformed a capitalization-weighted index of the same universe (see <a href=\"http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/features/16411-index-monkeys-beat-cap-weighting.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=DailyEmailBlast\">http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/features/16411-index-monkeys-beat-cap-weighting.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=DailyEmailBlast</a>). In recent years it seems like everyone is bashing cap-weighted indices, so it was probably only a matter of time until apes took a shot. Maybe pigs and dolphins are next.The problem with this analysis is that the monkeys formed their portfolios by choosing stocks so that each stock (of 1000 in the test universe) had an equal likelihood of being selected and/or overweighted by each monkey. This more or less guarantees that the monkeys' portfolios, perhaps with a very few exceptions, will have a small cap bias. In a period when we know that small size paid off, it's not surprising that the monkeys outperform cap weighting.One of the virtues of a cap-weighted index is that it accurately reflects the nature of the investor's opportunity set. Otherwise said, the world is cap-weighted. An investment dollar chosen at random is not equally likely to be invested in Apple Computer as on the smallest stock in the universe. It is much more likely to be invested in Apple. The monkeys presumably did not know this, and thus, in a particular way, behaved anything but randomly."

If some <i>soi-disant</i> index funds \"aren't,\" which ones \"are\" -- or, at the most basic level, what is an index?A good working definition of an index is this: an index is a portfolio in which constituent and weighting changes are not motivated by alpha-seeking. (Read \"alpha\" as excess or above-average return.) The contrast with active management is clear; the manager of an active portfolio typically <i>only makes changes</i> that are motivated by alpha-seeking. If not alpha, what objectives might drive the managers of index portfolios? Historically we can identify three stages of index evolution:<ul>\t<li>Asset class replication. A good example here is the S&amp;P 500, which aims to represent the U.S. equity market.</li>\t<li>Subsets and extensions of basic asset class replication.

The distinctive quality of factor indices is that they aim to deliver a particular pattern of returns -- in our examples, a pattern characterized by less volatility or higher yield.</li></ul>It's this last category whose bona fides the Journal seemed to question, and admittedly the line between active and passive here is a bit more gray.

William Shakespeare’s famous quote from Hamlet, 'To be, or not to be, that is the question' can be rephrased by investors comparing high yield to senior loans as 'secured, or unsecured, that is the question,' when pondering the risks of each product. Senior loans rank higher in the capital structure and are secured to the assets of the business, unlike the unsecured nature of high yield bonds. The loan's coupon is typically the higher of a floor rate or a certain spread over three-month LIBOR. Because their coupons are tied to a short-term rate, senior loans have less interest rate risk and are considered a floating rate instrument. In a rising rate environment, senior loans are at an advantage to high yield whose bullet structure and fixed coupon would be negatively affected. Not surprisingly, senior loans tend to have slightly smaller, but less volatile returns than high yield bonds (See Total Returns table).When investing in lower rated credit instruments, the risk of default should always be a concern. Though now, after the 2008 financial crisis, the majority of companies have put their balance sheets back in relatively good financial shape. Presently, default rates are near historical lows, with senior loan defaults at 1.4% and high yield defaults at 2.3%.Weighing the risks, both senior loans and high yield bonds are attractive investments. Not only because of their higher yields, but also because they are relatively short investments which, when compared to other long term investments, won’t be as affected by changes in long term rates.

		"post_content" : "Indices existed well before the launch of indexed financial products. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, e.g., goes back to 1896; the first indexed institutional portfolios appeared in the 1970s, the first index mutual fund in 1976, and the first index-tracking exchange traded funds in the 1990s. In all these cases, the index provider was independent of the provider of the index-linked financial product.We think that this independence is an under-appreciated aspect of the success and growth of indexed assets. There are three distinct steps that separate the investor from the product:<ul>\t<li><strong> Data</strong> -- price and volume data must first be created (on a securities exchange or otherwise) and aggregated</li>\t<li><strong>Index</strong> -- using price data and other inputs, an index is created</li>\t<li><strong> Product</strong> -- an investment product is created by linking to an index</li></ul>Independent index providers (ourselves prominent among them) occupy only the middle stage of this process.To see why this is important, consider what happens when the second step is combined with either the first or the third. For an example of why combining the first two steps (data generation and index creation) is undesirable, think of the word \"LIBOR.\" The LIBOR scandals of the last year were only possible because the same entities controlled both the data and the index. An independent provider would have had the ability to audit and challenge the raw inputs, helping to insure the integrity if the index creation process.Combining steps two and three can be equally problematic, if less obviously so. When the same entity provides both index and product, how can the end user assess the performance of the index portfolio manager? And how can he know whether index construction decisions are being driven by the best interests of the client or by the commercial interests of the product provider?Investing in an indexed product without an independent index provider is like playing tennis without a net. It may be good exercise, but it's not the same game."

		"post_content" : "<strong>Year-to-Date S&amp;P GSCI is off 6.81%</strong><ul>\t<li>S&amp;P GSCI Gold had its biggest one day loss ever,-9.3%, on April 15, 2013, since its inception on Jan 6, 1978, and hit its lowest level since Feb 2, 2011. The decline was due to worries about central bank sales, especially from Cyprus, but also, from the Fed winding down bond purchases.  However, buying improved from India ahead of the Akshaya Tritiya, a gold buying festival, next month.Also, the wedding season has started and will continue until June. The S&amp;P GSCI Silver hit its lowest level on April 19, 2013 since Oct 4, 2010.  On April 15, 2013, the S&amp;P GSCI Silver had its 6th biggest one-day drop, 11.3%,  since its inception on Jan 5, 1973.</li></ul><ul>\t<li>Weak economic data including cooling factory activity and a rise in jobless claims drove the S&amp;P GSCI Energy down 2.9% last week for a total loss in April of 8.8%.The S&amp;P GSCI Unleaded Gasoline lost 11.3% MTD after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported gasoline demand was at a 16-year low. Despite the fall across the energy sector, the S&amp;P GSCI Natural Gas added 4.1% last week bringing the MTD and YTD returns up to 9.2% and 26.7%, respectively. continues to rally from cold weather and high electric power sector demand, especially as stricter environmental rules make coal burning more expensive.</li></ul><ul>\t<li>Cold weather also increased demand for warm drinks like hot cocoa and coffee as better-than-expected first-quarter North American cocoa grindings rose nearly 6%.

		"post_content" : "A recently published paper received a fair amount of publicity for its suggestion that portfolios selected randomly by monkeys would have outperformed a capitalization-weighted index of the same universe (see <a href=\"http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/features/16411-index-monkeys-beat-cap-weighting.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=DailyEmailBlast\">http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/features/16411-index-monkeys-beat-cap-weighting.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=DailyEmailBlast</a>). In recent years it seems like everyone is bashing cap-weighted indices, so it was probably only a matter of time until apes took a shot. Maybe pigs and dolphins are next.The problem with this analysis is that the monkeys formed their portfolios by choosing stocks so that each stock (of 1000 in the test universe) had an equal likelihood of being selected and/or overweighted by each monkey. This more or less guarantees that the monkeys' portfolios, perhaps with a very few exceptions, will have a small cap bias. In a period when we know that small size paid off, it's not surprising that the monkeys outperform cap weighting.One of the virtues of a cap-weighted index is that it accurately reflects the nature of the investor's opportunity set. Otherwise said, the world is cap-weighted. An investment dollar chosen at random is not equally likely to be invested in Apple Computer as on the smallest stock in the universe. It is much more likely to be invested in Apple. The monkeys presumably did not know this, and thus, in a particular way, behaved anything but randomly."

		"post_content" : "The Wall Street Journal recently urged its readers to \"Beware of Index Funds That Aren't\" (<a href=\"http://on.wsj.com/Xycv7P\">http://on.wsj.com/Xycv7P</a>). If some <i>soi-disant</i> index funds \"aren't,\" which ones \"are\" -- or, at the most basic level, what is an index?A good working definition of an index is this: an index is a portfolio in which constituent and weighting changes are not motivated by alpha-seeking. (Read \"alpha\" as excess or above-average return.) The contrast with active management is clear; the manager of an active portfolio typically <i>only makes changes</i> that are motivated by alpha-seeking. If not alpha, what objectives might drive the managers of index portfolios? Historically we can identify three stages of index evolution:<ul>\t<li>Asset class replication. A good example here is the S&amp;P 500, which aims to represent the U.S. equity market.</li>\t<li>Subsets and extensions of basic asset class replication. Examples would include the S&amp;P MidCap 400 or Small Cap 600, as well as sector and style (growth and value) indices.</li>\t<li>Factor or strategy indices -- e.g., the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility Index or the Dow Jones Select Dividend Index. The distinctive quality of factor indices is that they aim to deliver a particular pattern of returns -- in our examples, a pattern characterized by less volatility or higher yield.</li></ul>It's this last category whose bona fides the Journal seemed to question, and admittedly the line between active and passive here is a bit more gray. (See, e.g., <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-the-limits-of-history.pdf\">http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-the-limits-of-history.pdf</a>.) But well-constructed factor indices can provide defined patterns of return without requiring the payment of active management fees. This makes them a valuable addition to any passive investor's toolkit."

		"post_content" : "The market for credit default swaps is typically not well-understood by equity investors (myself emphatically included).  This is unfortunate, since the price of insuring a company's bonds (which is what a CDS measures) can sometimes provide insight into the same company's equity securities.For example, in September 2012, the S&amp;P 500 financials sector began to open up a large performance advantage over the S&amp;P 500, after running neck and neck with the 500 earlier in the year.  But the relative price of insuring financial sector debt began to cheapen dramatically in May, <i>four months before the start of the equity rally</i>, as shown at <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/iis-leading-indicator-or-confirming-evidence.pdf\">http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/iis-leading-indicator-or-confirming-evidence.pdf</a>.More recently, U.S. bank stocks performed much better than their European counterparts in the first quarter of 2013.This seems appropriate in view of the continuing supply of Cypriot headlines, although it’s notable that until mid-February the Europeans were in the lead.But the relative cost of insuring European bank debt began to increase <i>in January</i>-well before the equity markets adjusted.  In anthropomorphic terms, the equity and CDS markets temporarily 'disagreed;' the disagreement was resolved in February and March when European bank stocks underperformed (by quite a lot).  (See <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/iis-european-bank-woes-reflected-across-asset-classes.pdf\">http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/iis-european-bank-woes-reflected-across-asset-classes.pdf</a> for more details.)It appears, at least on the surface, that in these two cases movements in CDS prices foreshadowed later developments in the equity market.Of course two anecdotes do not a summer make.But the interconnections are none the less intriguing.In a world of integrated capital markets, equity and fixed income markets probably can’t agree to disagree for long."

		"post_content" : "Indices existed well before the launch of indexed financial products. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, e.g., goes back to 1896; the first indexed institutional portfolios appeared in the 1970s, the first index mutual fund in 1976, and the first index-tracking exchange traded funds in the 1990s. In all these cases, the index provider was independent of the provider of the index-linked financial product.We think that this independence is an under-appreciated aspect of the success and growth of indexed assets. There are three distinct steps that separate the investor from the product:<ul>\t<li><strong> Data</strong> -- price and volume data must first be created (on a securities exchange or otherwise) and aggregated</li>\t<li><strong>Index</strong> -- using price data and other inputs, an index is created</li>\t<li><strong> Product</strong> -- an investment product is created by linking to an index</li></ul>Independent index providers (ourselves prominent among them) occupy only the middle stage of this process.To see why this is important, consider what happens when the second step is combined with either the first or the third. For an example of why combining the first two steps (data generation and index creation) is undesirable, think of the word \"LIBOR.\" The LIBOR scandals of the last year were only possible because the same entities controlled both the data and the index. An independent provider would have had the ability to audit and challenge the raw inputs, helping to insure the integrity if the index creation process.Combining steps two and three can be equally problematic, if less obviously so. When the same entity provides both index and product, how can the end user assess the performance of the index portfolio manager? And how can he know whether index construction decisions are being driven by the best interests of the client or by the commercial interests of the product provider?Investing in an indexed product without an independent index provider is like playing tennis without a net. It may be good exercise, but it's not the same game."

For the first quarter of 2013, e.g., we can observe that:<ul>\t<li>The equity markets were very strong (no revelation there), with both the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 both up more than 10% and at record levels by quarter-end.</li>\t<li>Strangely for such a strong quarter, defensive indices outperformed the general market. S&amp;P 500 Value topped both S&amp;P 500 Growth and the S&amp;P 500 (granted by only a whisker in the latter case). More interestingly, such defensive stalwarts as S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats and S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility came in well ahead of the S&amp;P 500.</li>\t<li>This pattern also turned up at the sector level. For the quarter, the best performing S&amp;P 500 sectors were Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilities, all of which strike a defensive note.</li></ul>"

		"post_content" : "There is a growing debate among economists, journalist and bloggers over whether the Fed's QE3 is creating a bubble in the stock market. (See <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/too-much-talk-about-liquidity/\" target=\"_blank\">Krugman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0810ce9a-be2c-11e2-9b27-00144feab7de.html#axzz2T8P7iqmP\" target=\"_blank\">Gillian Tett </a>or<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/05/22/dont-fear-the-bubble/\" target=\"_blank\"> Felix Salmon </a>among others) fueled by the market's gains since the start of the year and the usual worries that disaster will strike during the summer break at the beach.There are optimists: some say that \"Sell in May and Go Away\" should be \"Buy in May and Make Hay.\"Virtually all agree -- correctly -- that the Fed's low interest rates and QE3 policy is boosting stock prices. Further, all also agree, again correctly, that the Fed will sooner or later stop QE3 (or QE4 or QE5) and interest rates will rise. Rising interest rates are usually not the best medicine for the stock market although they don't spell complete or immediate doom. Even with the Fed, QE3 and maybe some more QEs, the bubble fears look overdone from here.First, a bubble is more than anything that results in a crash and collapse.A bubble usually builds itself on speculative mania as it departs from any link to funamental financial factors.As the bubble worriers themselves demonstrate, there are plenty of people worrying that the market will collapse and very few expecting it to rise forever more from here.We're not seeing genuine specualtive mania, at least not yet.Remember \"Home Prices Never Fall\" or recall names like Pets.com?Little of that is being seen in the market now. Second, while low interest rates are boosting stock prices, that is a fundamental financial factor making stock more attractive.Of course, the key part of any bubble is when it bursts.Bursting bubbles cause damge because they change the state of the world and because they pop when no one is expecting it.Possibly the only thing being watched more carefully than the Dow and the S&amp;P these days is the Fed. And, unlike either the Dow or the S&amp;P, the Fed can send out warning signals -- and probably will when the time comes.Where does all this leave us? Even without bubbles the market can go down.We used to call those disappointments corrections.The market is still as unpredicatable as ever so one need not believe every voice of doom that bubbles up."

		"post_content" : "Chairman Ben Bernanke has tried to be cautious in scripting a message to the markets, but recent communications out of the Federal Reserve have been mixed.With seven members of the Board representing 12 districts and past members all speaking to the press, the message can get convoluted at times.The planning and timing to pare down the central bank’s bond buying program is at the heart of the issue. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, has been quoted as saying that the reason the country hasn’t seen more job growth is due to fiscal policy.He has been vocal about reducing stimulus purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds, pointing to recent positive news on the recovering housing market.Joining in the conversation is Philadelphia Fed president Charles Plosser, who also supports a gradual slowdown in bond buying.Given such aggressive conversation by highly placed individuals, the market took heed as the yield on the <b>S&amp;P/BGCantor 7-10 Year U.S. Treasury Bond Index</b> moved 45 basis points wider, from a recent low of 1.35% on May 1<sup>st</sup> to its current level of 1.80%.The rising interest rates also affect credit as the<b> S&amp;P U.S. Issued Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index</b> returns a -1.98% month-to-date return and a -0.39% year-to-date.High Yield’s month-to-date return is presently negative at a -0.44%, while for the year it is returning a 4.05% as measured by the <b>S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index</b>. Senior Loans have held steady returning 0.19% to date and 2.93% for the year.The spread between the yield-to-maturity of the senior loan and high yield indices has widened since its start-of-the-year level of 33 basis points to its current level of 77 basis points.Though both the <b>S&amp;P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index</b> and the <b>S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index</b> have seen their yields trend downward from the start of the year, loans have experienced more downward movement dropping 75 bps, while high yield only moved 31 bps.The <b>S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index</b> had held its relatively loftier rates until recently.Since May 8<sup>th</sup>, the yield on the index has increased from a 5.54% to 5.84%.The <b>S&amp;P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index </b>yield stepped up a week and a half later, rising on May 23<sup>rd</sup> by 10 bps from 4.98% to 5.08%. The higher volatility reaction to rising rates for high yield makes sense when compared to loans.High yield bonds have more interest rate sensitivity with duration of just less than 5 years and an average maturity of 6.8 years.Loans, on the other hand, have an average life of around 4 years.Their duration is 7 days, as the index is rebalanced weekly and adjusted for rate changes, making the <b>S&amp;P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index </b>a floating rate product.<b></b><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-406\" title=\"Spread Graph of the S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index  vs. the S&amp;P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index \" alt=\"\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HYLL-1.png\" width=\"558\" height=\"329\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-496\" alt=\"Mixed Signals as Rates Rise\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HYLL-22.png\" width=\"545\" height=\"329\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC and/or its affiliates.

In 1994 the Fed tightened policy and interest rates rose faster and higher than investors expected.The chart shows the yield on ten year treasury notes -- the same instrument everyone is talking about today at a yield of about 2.2% -- and the S&amp;P 500.As seen there, the market didn't respond very much to the rise that began in late 1993 and early 1994; it did react when rates turned down late in 1994.Of course there is no assurance that this time might be like the last time.&nbsp;"

Overall shares have slightly increased, as issuance has outpaced repurchases. In the first quarter the overall share count was up, with the Information Technology sector, the leader in buybacks, slightly increasing its overall share count by 0.9%. The Telecommunications Sector, led by AT&amp;T, which has reduced its share count by 6.9% over the last four quarters, reduced its overall share count by 3.5%.The Information Technology Sector held its position as the largest repurchaser, spending $17.5B, which was down from the $22.7B spent in Q4.The Health Care Sector was right behind IT, as it increased to $16.8B from $11.4B, with Telecommunications increasing from $4.4B in Q4,’12 to $6.5B in Q1.AT&amp;T led with a $5.9B expenditure (up from $4.4B), followed by Exxon Mobil ($5.6B), Pfizer ($4.6B), IBM ($2.6B), and JP Morgan ($2.6B).Given all of the talk and authorizations, there is great expectation for the second quarter, especially from Apple, which announced a record authorization.Share prices for Q2,’13 are running 6.3% higher than Q1,’13 and 19.3% higher than Q2,’12. This means that companies will need to spend more just to buy back the same number of shares, and spend additional funds if they wish to create share count reduction. They talked the talk, now we’ll see if they walk the walk.(FYI-cash has again set a new record, be it by 0.17% gain)"

In the past 10 years, using yoy% (year-over-year) monthly return data from 1/2003-12/2012, the DJ-UBS CI has had correlation of 0.64 to CPI yoy Index and the S&amp;P GSCI has had correlation of 0.74 to CPI yoy Index. This is because commodity indices reflect our changing expectation of future prices by including futures contracts as constituents. Further, since food and energy are major components of the CPI and are among the most volatile of inflation, they are the key drivers of the indices.<div></div><div><div>Click here to see a chart <a style=\"color: #0f3647;font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Inflation-Correlation.pptx\" target=\"_blank\">Inflation Correlation</a></div><div></div><div>HO<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1\">W M</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1\">UCH INFLATION PROTECTION HAVE COMMODITIES PROVIDED?</span></div><div>Commodity index investments may provide a levered response to inflation.In other words, one dollar of commodities may hedge more than one dollar of the portfolio from inflation. This concept is called inflation beta. Historically from 1992-2012 for every 1% increase in CPI, the S&amp;P GSCI has had a 16.0% increase and the DJ-UBS CI has had a 10.2% increase.

		"post_content" : "The Federal Open Market Committee -- the Fed's policy making unit -- meets today and tomorrow.Recent reports show the economy expanding, but not accelerating. Housing starts and consumer prices both slightly weaker than expected in today's reports.Given this and recent misplaced fears that the Fed was about to end QE3, most analysts look for little change in Fed policy combined with some comments meant to end worries about a quick end to current policy.Separately, President Obama made remarks in an interview reported by Bloomberg and by the Wall Street Journal suggesting that Fed Chairman Bernanke will step down at the end of his current term in January 2014.Almost every economist who has served in the Obama administration or worked at the Fed in the last few years is being mentioned as a replacement -- in other words, no one knows who might be chosen. However, given the current soft economic recovery and Bernanke's success at the Fed, a new Fed chairperson is not likely to make a dramatic shift in policy.&nbsp;"

		"post_content" : "Index funds could experience slightly more trading than usual on Friday.Company's shares outstanding change from time to time due to buy-backs, issuance for employee options or other events. The percentage of shares in float -- not closely held -- also change from time to time.In theory S&amp;P Dow Jones could update data on the number of shares outstanding for companies in its indices daily; but most of these changes are small and dealing with numerous tiny changes would be costly for index fund managers.As a result, changes of less than 5% of the number of shares outstanding are done once a quarter on the third Friday of the last month of the quarter -- next Friday, June 21st.This is the same day that futures and options contracts expire, so there is plenty of liquidity in the market.These are all small adjustments since large share changes related to mergers are done when the merger closes.Aside from slightly more trading than typical for Friday in summer, there isn't likely to be any impact. The indices affected include the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P MidCap 400 and the S&amp;P Small Cap 600, among others. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is price-weighted: stock prices, but not share outstanding, matter for the calculation so there is no rebalance for the Dow."

Inflation is expected to remain low and unemployment will drift down a bit, averaging 7.5% this year and 7.2% next year.The IMF applauds Fed policy, commenting \"the Fed appropriately continued to add monetary policy accommodation over the past year...\" but does not offer any comments on what the central bank might do next.On fiscal policy (taxes and spending) the comments are more pointed and less complimentary: \"On the fiscal front deficit reduction in 2013 has been excessively rapid and ill-designed.\"The IMF calls for repealing the sequester and replacing it with a more balance and back-loaded program of fiscal policy and for a early increased in the debt ceiling.While the number one short term concern for the market is what the Fed does next, the IMF's comments about the debt ceiling and fiscal policy point to the key issues for how the market behaves in the second half of 2013."

In 1994 the Fed tightened policy and interest rates rose faster and higher than investors expected.The chart shows the yield on ten year treasury notes -- the same instrument everyone is talking about today at a yield of about 2.2% -- and the S&amp;P 500.As seen there, the market didn't respond very much to the rise that began in late 1993 and early 1994; it did react when rates turned down late in 1994.Of course there is no assurance that this time might be like the last time.&nbsp;"

Despite those remarks, the Fed expects rates to remain low into 2015.Behind all this is a factor bigger than even the Fed -- the economy.If the economy continues to strengthen interest rates will rise and if the economy reverses and turns down, rates will drop.

		"post_content" : "The FOMC statement and Ben Bernanke's press conference was not well received this afternoon.Hopes for something that would smooth over the recent volatility with assurances that QE3 would last for many more months to come were dashed by comments during the press conference that most FOMC members could see bond buying tapering off this fall and ending by sometime in 2014. Despite those remarks, the Fed expects rates to remain low into 2015.Behind all this is a factor bigger than even the Fed -- the economy.If the economy continues to strengthen interest rates will rise and if the economy reverses and turns down, rates will drop. Given the Fed's 2015 forecast of 2.9% to 3.6% GDP growth, inflation of 1.7% to 2% on Core PCE and unemployment of 5.8 to 6.2%, interest rates will be slightly higher in 2015 but not out of sight. Look for the ten year treasury to be 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015.The rest of the Fed's economic projections slightly lowered the outlook for the rest of 2013 and made 2014 look a bit better.In the short run traders can't fight the Fed, but in the long run the Fed can't fight the economy."

		"post_content" : "After two months of deflation, headline CPI (Consumer Price Index) gained 0.1% in May, marking its second positive reading in at least the past seven months. Over the past 12 months, CPI inflation is up 1.4%, accelerating from April’s 1.1% reading. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm</a>Historically, commodities as an asset class have had positive correlation to inflation. In the past 10 years, using yoy% (year-over-year) monthly return data from 1/2003-12/2012, the DJ-UBS CI has had correlation of 0.64 to CPI yoy Index and the S&amp;P GSCI has had correlation of 0.74 to CPI yoy Index. This is because commodity indices reflect our changing expectation of future prices by including futures contracts as constituents. Further, since food and energy are major components of the CPI and are among the most volatile of inflation, they are the key drivers of the indices.<div></div><div><div>Click here to see a chart <a style=\"color: #0f3647;font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Inflation-Correlation.pptx\" target=\"_blank\">Inflation Correlation</a></div><div></div><div>HO<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1\">W M</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1\">UCH INFLATION PROTECTION HAVE COMMODITIES PROVIDED?</span></div><div>Commodity index investments may provide a levered response to inflation.In other words, one dollar of commodities may hedge more than one dollar of the portfolio from inflation. This concept is called inflation beta. Historically from 1992-2012 for every 1% increase in CPI, the S&amp;P GSCI has had a 16.0% increase and the DJ-UBS CI has had a 10.2% increase.

Following the press release, markets sold off on confirmation that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. As the release stated, 'Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.'The selloff in the S&amp;P 500 resulted in an immediate 10 point drop, followed by a number of attempts to recover, finally ending the day down 22.88 at 1628.93. Bond prices also fell as the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose 8 basis points (bps) on the news. The previous day’s 2.18% close was quickly eclipsed as the 10-year note finished the day at 2.35%. The S&amp;P/BGCantor 10-20 Year U.S. Treasury Bond Index gave up 1.20% and is now down 4.24% on the year. The importance of an index like the 10-20 year index, with 10.07 years of duration, is that it’s an indicator for mortgage rates, which are benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury.The FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0%-0.25%, and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Fed's previously stated plan was to continue the stimulus as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5%, with an inflation goal of 2%. Today’s press conference hinted that a 7% unemployment rate would be an acceptable level to start curtailing quantitative easing. Hints of a possible early start to tapering took its toll on the credit markets as well.

Equity markets, not surprisingly, have reacted by weakening, especially in last week's trading.Some of us of a certain age will admit to a degree of bewilderment at this, since a 2.5% 10 year rate would have seemed ridiculously, if not unattainably, low for the vast majority of our working <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/research-income-beyond-bonds.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lives</a>.  Why are markets reacting so negatively to what, in most historical contexts, would have been considered a very favorable rate environment?The answer lies in the distinction between high rates and rising rates. A 2.5% Treasury yield is unquestionably not high by any reasonable historical standard, but rates have equally unquestionably been rising for the last two months. When rates are stable, whether high or low, the equity market is priced to reflect their stability. When rates change, the equity market adjusts to reflect the change.

For the month of June (through the close on Friday 6/21), the total return on the S&amp;P 500 is -2.23%, versus -1.38% for the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatilty Index.  Low Vol did what it typically does in bad markets by diminishing the parent index's decline.*There's another approach to dealing with increasingly volatile equity markets.  That approach is to own a long position in VIX futures -- in other words, to regard volatility as a diversifying asset for the investor's equity portfolio.  In this sense, volatility is analogous to an insurance policy.  The problem is that when you don't need it, volatility can be very expensive insurance.  For the year ended 6/21/13, e.g., the S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index declined by -69% (while the S&amp;P 500 rose by +23%).*  Holding a permanent or static portfolio weight in volatility is likely to be an expensive exercise.The S&amp;P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Index attempts to cheapen the implicit insurance cost of owning volatilty by altering its relative exposure to VIX and the underlying S&amp;P 500.

At other times, VEQTOR's vol exposures can be quite modest.  The combination of two negatively-correlated asset (equity and equity volatilty) can produce a smoother, hedged pattern of returns, especially in comparison to a fully-invested equity index.

		"post_content" : "Compared to a month ago, every major developed equity market is down, some by double digit percentage losses while bond yield have climbed over the same period.The U.S. markets-both stocks and bonds -- are among the least damaged.For investors the questions are when will it end?, where can one hide? and why?When will it end?Assume that the Fed’s forecast is right and the economy is improving and will continue to improve.Then the fortunes of stocks and bonds are likely to split with stocks recovering while bonds continue to suffer.An improving economy should help stocks turnaround while the Fed’s less generous attitude  combined with economic strength means bond yields will rise more.Markets tend to over react and overshoot when shocked as they were last week.Beware a bounce in stocks or bonds creating a false sense of security for all. If the Fed is too optimistic and the economy falters, we will see QE4; but, we might be too nervous to take advantage of it.Where can one hide?Not bonds, maybe stocks. Maybe the silver lining is we’ve seen the first tiny steps to being able to earn a (small) return on cash.What happened?Everyone knew that one day the Fed would end Quantitative Easing but  everyone believed that that day would never come.Then the Fed suggested a date-beginning of the end this fall, the end of the end next summer.If your ten year treasury is worth 100 today and will be worth 90 next summer, you don’t wait  to sell it.  You sell it now and all that selling makes it worth 90 right now.

Rather than lamenting the end of low interest artes, it is worth looking back at how we got here to consider the prospects going forward. The bond rally goes back decades to inflation rates and yields that sound impossible today. In the late 1970s inflation was well into double digits at 12% to 15%.  Though interest rates were rising, they were not quite keeping up with inflation so the real (inflation adjusted) cost of money was low and investors  rushed to buy houses and hard assets.  Despite repeated government efforts, inflation -- and the damage it wrought on the economy -- seemed unstoppable.  Paul Volcker, the newly appointed Fed chairman, led a sharp shift in Fed policy in October, 1979 which drove interest rates sky high, sent the economy into two back-to-back recessions and knocked inflation out.  Inflation dropped from 14.8% in March, 1980 to 2.6% in June, 1983.  The bank prime rate -- the analogy to Libor today -- peaked at 21% and in November of 1981 the Treasury sold 30 year bonds with a 14% coupon which out-performed the S&amp;P 500 the next  year as bond yields collapsed  So much for ancient history.The turmoil in 1979-81 whipped inflation and sparked the bond rally that either ended last week or, hopefully, is still with us. The chart shows how long it has run and how far yields have dropped -- from 14% to 2%.  The legacy the rally is more than last week's low yields; it is the almost complete absence of inflation.  Unlike the 1970s and early 1980s, investors don't have to constantly worry about inflation eating into their wealth or pushing bonds yields up and bond prices down.  The result is a fixed income market that responds to monetary policy and credit conditions, allowing investors to both gauge the attractiveness and hopefully profit from different fixed income assest classes. Who would look at municipal bonds were inflation at 8%, 10% or 12%.  There is no guarantee that inflation will remain low into the future, but if investors recognize the benefits of keeping price increases in control, the odds are that the Fed and others will hold inflation in check.The Great Bond rally may, or may not, be fading, but its legacy of low inflation is with us to the benefit of fixed income investing."

		"post_content" : "Congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks on their awesome win last night! I must admit I was very excited watching the most amazing finish I have ever seen in hockey, but as a commodity lady my first thought was about the metal in the Stanley Cup and what is it worth, especially given the current environment of a strengthening U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond yields.From the economic backdrop, silver and nickel, the two metals that form the cup, are the worst performing metals in their respective sectors. Year-to-date in 2013, the S&amp;P GSCI Silver is down 35.8% and the S&amp;P GSCI Nickel lost 20.8%. The cup is made up of 97% silver and 3% nickel, so just for fun, we thought we would chart a \"Stanley Cup Index\" to reflect historical levels of the alloy.[caption id=\"attachment_728\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stanley-Cup-Index.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-728\" alt=\"Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Stanley-Cup-Index-600x403.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"403\" /></a> Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

The \"Stanley Cup Index\" is computed using 3% of the S&amp;P GSCI Nickel Total Return and 97% Silver Total Return index levels. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.[/caption]Who won the most valuable Stanley Cup? The last time the Chicago Blackhawks took the title, the cup had about the same value as yesterday, only slightly higher at 213<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\"> versus yesterday's level of 205. However, while they were holding it, the index increased 153% to a high value of 538 on April 29, 2011-just before the Boston Bruins would take it over but at a value 27% off the high at an index level of 391.  </span>Although our hypothetical \"Stanley Cup Index\" only begins 20 years ago, as far back as we have the single commodity index data for nickel, there was a time where the cup was worth more. To illustrate roughly the cup in history as far back as 1927, the first time the Cup was solely contested by National Hockey League teams, one can look at the <a href=\"http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/gold-and-silver-prices-100-year-historical-chart\" target=\"_blank\">historical silver prices</a> on an inflation adjusted basis.  The approximate value of the original cup (100% sliver,) the historical price can be multiplied by the weight of 459.74 troy oz. According to this method, for example, yesterday the price was roughly $19.50 so the value of the cup was about $8,964.93. According to the chart, in 1979, when the Montreal Canadiens won, the value was approximately $12,307.24 and rose to a value of about $47,256.67 by Jan 1980. Not unlike the 2010-11 drop before the Bruins last won, the value of the cup dropped 55% to roughly $21,106.66 before the New York Islanders earned it.[caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Historical-SILVER-Prices.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-727\" alt=\"Historical real (inflation-adjusted)  silver prices back to 1915.

However, the rising popularity of ETFs have boosted the share of assets in passive or index-based investments.  Now comes a report that more and more investors -- including active managers -- are investing in passive or index-based investments.  <em>FTFM </em>reports that a \"survey of 1001 fund management professionals -- many of whom make their living promoting active products -- showed that two-thirds have invested a sizeable amount of their personal savings in passive products. And 45% said they have invested a 'significant portion' in such funds.\"One source of the rising popularity of index investing, even among active fund managers, is the growth in strategy indices offering a wide range of investment strategies through ETFs.  While market cap weighted index funds based on the S&amp;P 500 and other recognized indices continue to dominate the market, new ideas generate interest and attract assets.  A second reason for the growth of index investing is the fee differentials between passive and active management which favors passive investing.  Burton Malkiel who started the rush to passive investing with his book <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street </em> surveyed the field in a recent article in the <a href=\"http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.27.2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Journal of Economic Perspectives.</em></a>"

		"post_content" : "Compared to a month ago, every major developed equity market is down, some by double digits while bond yields have climbed over the same period.The U.S. markets-both stocks and bonds -- are among the least damaged.For investors the questions are when will it end?, where can one hide? and why?When will it end?Assume that the Fed’s forecast is right and the economy is improving and will continue to improve.Then the fortunes of stocks and bonds are likely to split with stocks recovering while bonds continue to suffer.An improving economy should help stocks turnaround while the Fed’s less generous attitude  combined with economic strength means bond yields will rise more.Markets tend to over react and overshoot when shocked as they were last week.Beware a bounce in stocks or bonds creating a false sense of security for all. If the Fed is too optimistic and the economy falters, we will see QE4; but, we might be too nervous to take advantage of it.Where can one hide?Not bonds, maybe stocks. Maybe the silver lining is we’ve seen the first tiny steps to being able to earn a (small) return on cash.What happened?Everyone knew that one day the Fed would end Quantitative Easing but  everyone believed that that day would never come.Then the Fed suggested a date-beginning of the end this fall, the end of the end next summer.If your ten year treasury is worth 100 today and will be worth 90 next summer, you don’t wait  to sell it.  You sell it now and all that selling makes it worth 90 now. This is what happened.  Rather than complaining about the fickle Fed, remember their job is to worry about what could go wrong, lean against the wind and act as 'the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed when the party was really warming up.' (The quote is from William McC. Martin, Fed chairman in the 1950s and 1960s, credit to the <a href=\"http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Conversable Economist blog</a> for the citation and a copy of the speech.)Scorecard:S&amp;P 500 down 4.7% and DJIA down 4.3% from the close on Tuesday 6/18 to the close on Monday 6/24. 10 year Treasury note yield rose 38 bp or 17% over same time period."

The stock market is down but has only retraced its steps back to late April or early May.Consensus outlook for the Fed is reductions in QE3 bond buying beginning in the fall and the complete end to QE3 sometime next summer.Interest rates are expected to rise, but there is little agreement as to how much.The Fed’s upbeat forecast for the economy of 3%-3.5% GDP growth in 2014 with continued low inflation is seen as a bit optimistic.And now…First, just because the Fed chairman Bernanke spent Wednesday afternoon explaining what the Fed expects and what it is likely to do, don’t believe it is locked-in or committed to a time table.The Fed can, and frequently does, change its plans if the economy and markets change. One line many economists attribute to John Maynard Keynes is, 'when the data change, I change my mind; what do you do?'Whether or not the Fed economists are Keynesians, they do change their minds when the data change.Second, if the Fed’s forecast turns out to be right-stronger growth, no inflation and less unemployment-the stock market’s prospects should look a whole lot better than in the last few days.The market can advance when interest rates are rising, especially of the cause of rising rates is faster economic growth.Third, not only is the rest of the world watching, and worrying, about the Fed; the Fed is also watching the rest of the world.One wild card may be China where there are lots of signs that economic growth is slowing and short term interest rates spiked earlier this week.Were Chinese economic growth to falter we would hear renewed concerns about the economy and speculation about continued quantitative easing.<em>Source: Data for the chart are daily data from 12/31/2012 to 6/21/2013 as of 6/21/2013. 10-year Treasury yield is from Bloomberg, S&amp;P 500 is from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

		"post_content" : "The FOMC statement and Ben Bernanke's press conference was not well received this afternoon.Hopes for something that would smooth over the recent volatility with assurances that QE3 would last for many more months to come were dashed by comments during the press conference that most FOMC members could see bond buying tapering off this fall and ending by sometime in 2014. Despite those remarks, the Fed expects rates to remain low into 2015.Behind all this is a factor bigger than even the Fed -- the economy.If the economy continues to strengthen interest rates will rise and if the economy reverses and turns down, rates will drop. Given the Fed's 2015 forecast of 2.9% to 3.6% GDP growth, inflation of 1.7% to 2% on Core PCE and unemployment of 5.8 to 6.2%, interest rates will be slightly higher in 2015 but not out of sight. Look for the ten year treasury to be 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015.The rest of the Fed's economic projections slightly lowered the outlook for the rest of 2013 and made 2014 look a bit better.In the short run traders can't fight the Fed, but in the long run the Fed can't fight the economy."

		"post_content" : "In a release on June 19<sup>th</sup> the S&amp;P Dow Jones US Index Committee raised the market cap guidelines used when selecting companies for the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;PMid Cap 400 and S&amp;P Small Cap 600. The new guidelines are:<ul>\t<li>S&amp;P 500: Over $4.6 billion, raised from $4 billion</li>\t<li>S&amp;P Mid Cap 400: $1.2 to $5.1 billion, raised from $1 to $4.4 billion</li>\t<li>S&amp;P SmallCap 600: $350 million to $1.6 Billion, raised from $300 million to $1.4 billion</li></ul>The changes reflect the market's movement since the bottom in March 2009 and especially in the last two years of gains.The last increase was almost two and a half years ago in February, 2011. Given the recent gains, what makes a company an S&amp;P 500 Company is a somewhat bigger hurdle than it was two years ago.The Index Committee monitors market developments as well as events affecting the indices. The guidelines help determine which index a company should be added to.Market cap is not the only factor affecting the selection of companies for the S&amp;P 500 and our other indices.Other criteria include what sector the company is in, its liquidity and financial viability and that it must be a U.S. company."

		"post_content" : "Just an aggravating stat for all those who keep talking about the enormous volatility. The historical average intraday high price over the intraday low price is a swing of 1.482%, with a 1% variance (high / low) occurring 71.3% of the time over the past 50 years. The 2013 year-to-date average is a 0.916% variance, and has occurred 34.5% of the time. 2008 had a 90.1% rate, an average daily high / low of 2.809%, with 27 times, over 10% of the trading days, when the market opened up or down over 1% and closed more than 1% in the other direction (14 opening higher than 1% and closing over 1% down, and 13 opening off 1% and closing up at least 1%), and that was just on the open and close. 2008 had 6 days of at least a 10% spread between the high and the low-think of the S&amp;P moving 160 points or the Dow 1,500 points intraday. More volatility then we we’ve had recently, yes, as long as recently is very short term."

		"post_content" : "Beginning in May and then aggressively following Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s June 19<sup>th</sup> press conference interest rates rose.The yield on the 10 year treasury both led the way and spooked the markets world-wide.  Analysts raised the specter of an early end to QE3, cited Bernanke’s comments and hinted that the central bank was about to abandon the markets. Stocks responded with a sharp slide. Just as it seemed that all were united in castigating the Fed for bringing on the inevitable end to bond bull market, a counter attack was launched.<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">In the week and a half since the press conference, the Fed has put on a full court press with <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/whatsnew.htm\" target=\"_blank\">speeches </a>from two Fed Governors and timely news stories pitching the idea that the rate rise was a case of premature market jitters. Why did rates rise? Some of the comments in Bernanke’s press conference reminded everyone that sooner or later QE3 would end and that, if the Fed’s economic forecast proved reasonably correct there would be no QE4.While no one wanted to be reminded that QE3 would end; there were other factors in the press conference and the market.Bernanke talked about beginning to taper off QE3 if the unemployment rate slipped into the neighborhood of 7%.Some may have confused this with comments from a few months ago that the Fed Funds target would remain zero to 25 bp until the unemployment rate reached 6.5% . (It is 7.6%, at least until the next report on Friday morning). The Fed has two unemployment rate targets-one for QE3 and another for the Fed Funds rate.</span>More important than the double unemployment rate targets, the Fed confirmed both in the press conference and in those recent speeches that monetary policy will respond to the economy and that it believes the economy is beginning to improve.The Fed’s own forecast for 2014 looks almost rosy at 3% to 3.5% real growth, at or above trend.That growth, rather than monetary policy, will boost interest rates.<strong>Who dun it</strong>? The number one suspect is the economy. As to the central bank, one might consider it an accessory before the fact-and offer a compliment for their success."

In simple terms, there may be more predominant shortages of commodities.Generally as inventories are abundant, there are higher storage costs, which reduce returns from a condition called contango where the longer-dated contracts are more expensive than near contracts.  As the inventories deplete, shortages may prevail, giving no value to storage for commercial consumers that need the commodities to make their goods, which is reflected in an opposite and profitable condition called backwardation.  This is shown below:[caption id=\"attachment_812\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"470\"]<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Forward-Curve.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-812\" alt=\"Chart is provided for illustrative purposes only.\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Forward-Curve.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"277\" /></a> Chart is provided for illustrative purposes only.[/caption]From Feb 1970 through June 2013, commodities have spent 58% of the 521 months in contango, which makes sense given the long-term cycles of inventory building and depletion. <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714\">Please see this illustrated in the following chart where backwardation or contango was </span>determined<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714\"> by the sign of the S&amp;P GSCI spot version subtracted from the S&amp;P GSCI Excess Return.

Please see the Performance Disclosure at the end of this document for more information regarding the inherent limitations associated with backtested performance.[/caption]<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">However, what is most interesting about this chart is the historical pattern of backwardation and contango. Notice prior to August 2004, the number of months spent in backwardation and contango were split 50%/50% and were mostly cyclical. Between Aug 2004 and May 2011, the environment was different and there were 79 of 82 months in contango, reflecting a time of excess inventory from the rush to supply closely followed by the demand destruction of the global financial crisis. Post May 2011, 1/3 of months have been in backwardation with 3 months occurring in 2011, 5 months in 2012 and 2 in 2013 (May and June).</span>What does it mean? If <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;line-height: 1.714285714\">there is a shift in environment going forward towards a world driven by expansion of demand, then backwardation may be more likely with more frequent cycle switching. If </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">this is the case, then like in 2012, </span>the fixed forward indices such as the S&amp;P GSCI 3-Month Forward may underperform the <a href=\"http://www.spindices.com/indices/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI </a>(which holds the nearby most liquid contracts) and more dynamic indices like the <a href=\"http://www.spindices.com/indices/commodities/sp-gsci-dynamic-roll\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI Dynamic Roll</a> (which changes contracts based on term-structure) and the newly launched S&amp;P GSCI Roll Weight Select (which changes weights based on term-structure)."

		"post_content" : "The S&amp;P 500 closed at a new all-time high this afternoon at 1675.02, up from the previous record at 1669.16 set on May 21<sup>st</sup> and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 15460.92 setting a record and up from 15409.39 on May 28<sup>th</sup>. What does a new high mean? Good copy for journalists, positive reinforcement for investors that they made the right choice and hope for yet another new high.  New highs also mean that investors are getting wealthier and might help the economy with some spending. A rough guess is that at these index levels, each one point increase in the S&amp;P 500 adds close to one billion dollars to portfolios tracking the index all around the world.It also adds roughly nine times that to other portfolios holding some index stocks but not tracking the whole list.The stock market and the S&amp;P 500 do reflect investor sentiment and are leading indicators for the U.S. economy. Today’s closing high may have been an immediate result of comments Fed Chairman Bernanke made yesterday-they are also another sign that the economy is looking up and that the Fed’s past efforts are producing some positive results."

		"post_content" : "Most stock indices where the weight of each stock depends on its market value are 'float adjusted' meaning that the index only counts those shares that are available to investors and excludes closely held shares or shares held by governments or other companies.The S&amp;P 500 moved to float adjustment in in 2004-2005.Initially many investors expected substantial changes would result.By most estimates, between 10% and 15% of the stock of each company in the index is held by ETFs or indexed money managed for pensions, endowments or mutual funds.With a block that large held by index trackers, it would seem that counting only the stock that is readily available to investors and index trackers would matter.There were two counter arguments raised by some analysts. First, the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are all liquid. Currently a stock should exhibit at least 100% share turnover in a year when it joins the index; most companies in the index surpass this by a wide margin.Second, the index has a long-standing requirement that at least 50% of a company’s outstanding stock be part of the public float when it entered the index so low-float companies were excluded.Looking back to September 2005, when the index became float adjusted, we can see the results of float adjustment.The chart shows the official or float adjusted S&amp;P 500 and the same index without float adjustment. (S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices calculates both versions.)In terms of price performance, the difference is very small–barely visible on the chart.The difference in index levels on July 26, 2013-almost eight years since the introduction of float adjustment– is 13 index points or 77 basis points.The weight of the ten largest stocks in the float adjusted S&amp;P 500 as of July 26<sup>th</sup> close is 18.09%, slightly less than the ten largest stocks in the non-adjusted index which were 18.14%.One of the ten largest stocks in the non float-adjusted index, Wal-Mart, does not make it to the top ten in the float adjusted index because closely held shares are excluded.Does all this mean that float adjustment was unnecessary? No. Rather the average float factor-the percentage of shares in public float-across all 500 stocks in the index today is over 97%. In the U.S. large cap market segment that the S&amp;P 500 tracks, the vast majority of stock is not closely held.Compare the 97% to the same statistic for the S&amp;P Small Cap 600, 91% or the S&amp;P Europe 350 at 82%.<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Float-Chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-974\" alt=\"Float Chart\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Float-Chart-600x463.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"463\" /></a>Details on float adjustment are available on the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/index-policies/methodology-sp-float-adjustment.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">web site</a>,"

		"post_content" : "Despite strong double-digit gains in the equity markets last year, S&amp;P 500 issues posted record pension and OPEB underfunding in 2012. The double-digit equity gains of 2012 were no match for the artificially low interest rates which vaulted pension liabilities into record underfunding territory. Companies have only 77 cents for each dollar they owe in pensions and only 22 cents for each dollar of OPEB obligations. Overall, pensions and OPEB remain a manageable expense, currently within income and assets levels. Pensions funding should improve since interest rates have risen -&gt; the higher the interest rate used the lower the discounted liabilities.The full report, \"S&amp;P 500 2012 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB): The Final Frontier\", can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.spdji.com/sp500\">www.spdji.com/sp500.</a><b>Defined pensions</b> underfunding set a new record at $451.7B in 2012, up $97B billion from $354.7B in 2011 (up $206.7B from $245B in 2010). The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.41% and the S&amp;P Global BMI ex-U.S. added 14.05%, but it’s what you owe more than what you have. Pension funding rate decreased to 77.3% from 78.8% in 2011 (83.9% in 2010). Pension return rates declined for the 12th consecutive year, to 7.31% from 7.60% in 2011 (7.73% in 2010). Discount rates declined for the fourth year in a row, falling 78 bps to 3.93% from 4.71% in 2011 (5.31% in 2010), significantly increasing projected obligations.Funds maintained 2011 allocations in 2012 in an attempt to manage forward risk from markets. Equity allocations ticked up to 48.6% from 48.4%. Fixed income allocations ticked down to 40.4% from 40.9%.<b>OPEB</b> underfunded increased to $234.9B from $223.4B in 2011 ($210.1B in 2010). Funding rate increased to 22.3% from 21.8%. OPEB remains a target for cuts. Medical coverage is now a political as well as social issue.<b>Combined</b>, S&amp;P 500 companies have set aside $1.60 trillion in pensions &amp; OPEB funds to cover $2.29 trillion in obligations,with the resulting underfunding equating to $686.6B, or a 70.0% overall funding rate.Companies continue to shift retirement risk to the individual. The good news for current retirees is that most S&amp;P 500 large-cap issues have enough cash and resources available to cover the expense. The bad news is for future retirees, whose benefits have been reduced or cut and will need to find a way to supplement, or postpone their retirement. <b>The American dream</b> of a golden retirement for baby boomers has dissipated for most.Legacy pension and OPEB programs will mostly work their way out of the last bastions of the U.S. labor market over the next several decades. For baby-boomers it is already too late to safely build-up assets, outside of working longer or living more frugally in retirement. For younger workers, there is a need to start early, permitting time to compound their returns for their retirement. <b>For individuals</b>, the personal wealth depletion, via lower housing and equity positions, combined with lower pension and OPEB benefits (as longevity and the cost of staying healthy continue to escalate), has left potential retirees with little ability to retire. The current economic reality of strained government programs, the need for additional revenue (taxes), reduced spending (entitlement programs), and higher social costs have heralded a return to the retirement of prior generations: you work for most of your longer life and spend your remaining years in retirement in a reduced lifestyle.The result is that the American dream of a golden retirement for upcoming baby boomers is quickly dissipating. The current situation leaves few options for a comfortable retirement, and few years for baby boomers to significantly add to their retirement resources, outside of working longer.<b>Personal: </b><b>Let me put it this way</b>, my teenage kids worked last summer (and this one) and I ‘talked’ them into opening up a Roth IRA, even though they won’t get the money for almost fifty years (I matched their contributions- think I did good, considering I could have gotten stuck with the entire amount).It will be difficult for my generation, where many of us are split between our old IRAs, pensions (most being frozen), 401k and savings.But for the next generation, its looks like it’s all on them.So they need to start early, and let time compound their early contributions (amazing, I used to worry about their college fund, now I’m trying to help start them off for their retirement-and I’m still working; middle-class is strange, just glad I can do it)."

Volatility itself declined sharply, as it typically does in good markets, although our Dynamic VEQTOR Index turned in a positive (+2.31%) result.The international equity markets were also up strongly, with the S&amp;P Europe 350 gaining +7.42% to pace the field.Emerging markets (+0.83%) were much weaker than their developed counterparts, with Latin America (-1.64%) proving a drag on performance.Even commodities had a good month, led by their energy components -- the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index rose by +1.36%, and the more energy-laden S&amp;P GSCI gained +4.91%.Of course, there's a dark lining in every silver cloud, and this month, as in May and June, long-term interest rates rose.The S&amp;P/BGCantor 20+ Year U.S. Treasury Index fell -1.61%, with its 7-10 year counterpart off -0.43%Shorter duration indices dodged the bullet; the S&amp;P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index gained +1.22% in July."

However, this July, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/indices/commodities/sp-gsci-unleaded-gasoline\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI Unleaded Gasoline </a> gained 12.0%, which was the 4th highest increase in July in the history of the index (since 1988,) and the biggest rise in July since 2005 when the index increased 13.6%. The other years with big July increases were 1990, up 19.0%, and 2004, up 14.7%. While the index fell 11.1% in Aug 2004, it rose 17.6% in Sept that year. However, August 1990 and August 2005 subsequently jumped significantly, up 49.5% and 36.6%, respectively.  It will be interesting to see where gas price go this August.Why has this summer's gas price increased so much?

This increase is from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem\">new infrastructure that has helped drain supplies and inventories from the U.S. benchmark supply point at Cushing, Oklahoma. The </span><a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. government data </a>showed oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point fell for a fifth straight week to the lowest since April 2012.

		"post_content" : "Diversification means different things in different contexts.We can speak, for example, of diversification within an equity portfolio -- i.e., of holding a number of stocks with potentially-offsetting risks, as opposed to concentrating on only one issue or on a handful of similar stocks.Or we can think of diversification across asset classes -- e.g., by adding bonds, or international stocks, or commodities to a (diversified) U.S. equity portfolio.Conventional wisdom smiles on these two forms of diversification, and rightly so, since the final diversified portfolio typically has a higher expected return, or lower expected risk, than the starting portfolio.But diversification might not always be a good idea.Suppose I go a casino, find the roulette wheel, and bet on a number at random.I’m likely to lose my money.If I do the same thing a second time, and a third, the result is likely to be the same.<strong>I haven't created a diversified portfolio of bets -- I've merely repeated the same mistake several times over.</strong>A recent <a href=\"http://www.rickferri.com/WhitePaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> asks whether the selection of active investment managers is a useful or fruitless form of diversification.(Spoiler alert: fruitless.)Why?Active managers, more often than not, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">underperform</a> the indices against which they’re benchmarked.An investor who chooses an actively-managed fund over an index fund is therefore more likely than not to underperform.Adding a second and third actively-managed fund is likely to leave the investor worse off than he was with only one (just as multiple turns at the roulette wheel are likely to leave a gambler poorer than he was after his first bet).<strong>If it were easy to find outperforming active funds, diversifying active management might be beneficial.</strong>But it's not easy -- and that implies, as discussed <a href=\"http://www.spindices.com/multimedia-center/portfolio-structure-index-vs-active\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, that picking active managers is one of those areas where diversification fails."

Stocks responded with a sharp slide.

Why did rates rise? Some of the comments in Bernanke’s press conference reminded everyone that sooner or later QE3 would end and that, if the Fed’s economic forecast proved reasonably correct there would be no QE4.While no one wanted to be reminded that QE3 would end; there were other factors in the press conference and the market.Bernanke talked about beginning to taper off QE3 if the unemployment rate slipped into the neighborhood of 7%.Some may have confused this with comments from a few months ago that the Fed Funds target would remain zero to 25 bp until the unemployment rate reached 6.5% . (It is 7.6%, at least until the next report on Friday morning). The Fed has two unemployment rate targets-one for QE3 and another for the Fed Funds rate.</span>More important than the double unemployment rate targets, the Fed confirmed both in the press conference and in those recent speeches that monetary policy will respond to the economy and that it believes the economy is beginning to improve.The Fed’s own forecast for 2014 looks almost rosy at 3% to 3.5% real growth, at or above trend.That growth, rather than monetary policy, will boost interest rates.<strong>Who dun it</strong>? The number one suspect is the economy. As to the central bank, one might consider it an accessory before the fact-and offer a compliment for their success."

		"post_content" : "Diversification means different things in different contexts.We can speak, for example, of diversification within an equity portfolio -- i.e., of holding a number of stocks with potentially-offsetting risks, as opposed to concentrating on only one issue or on a handful of similar stocks.Or we can think of diversification across asset classes -- e.g., by adding bonds, or international stocks, or commodities to a (diversified) U.S. equity portfolio.Conventional wisdom smiles on these two forms of diversification, and rightly so, since the final diversified portfolio typically has a higher expected return, or lower expected risk, than the starting portfolio.But diversification might not always be a good idea.Suppose I go a casino, find the roulette wheel, and bet on a number at random.I’m likely to lose my money.If I do the same thing a second time, and a third, the result is likely to be the same.<strong>I haven't created a diversified portfolio of bets -- I've merely repeated the same mistake several times over.</strong>A recent <a href=\"http://www.rickferri.com/WhitePaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> asks whether the selection of active investment managers is a useful or fruitless form of diversification.(Spoiler alert: fruitless.)Why?Active managers, more often than not, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">underperform</a> the indices against which they’re benchmarked.An investor who chooses an actively-managed fund over an index fund is therefore more likely than not to underperform.Adding a second and third actively-managed fund is likely to leave the investor worse off than he was with only one (just as multiple turns at the roulette wheel are likely to leave a gambler poorer than he was after his first bet).<strong>If it were easy to find outperforming active funds, diversifying active management might be beneficial.</strong>But it's not easy -- and that implies, as discussed <a href=\"http://www.spindices.com/multimedia-center/portfolio-structure-index-vs-active\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, that picking active managers is one of those areas where diversification fails."

Overall shares have slightly increased, as issuance has outpaced repurchases. In the first quarter the overall share count was up, with the Information Technology sector, the leader in buybacks, slightly increasing its overall share count by 0.9%. The Telecommunications sector, led by AT&amp;T, which has reduced its share count by 6.9% over the last four quarters, reduced its overall share count by 3.5%.The Information Technology sector held its position as the largest repurchaser, spending $17.5B, which was down from the $22.7B spent in Q4The Health Care sector was right behind IT, as it increased to $16.8B, from $11.4B, with Telecommunications increasing from $4.4B in Q4,’12 to $6.5B in Q1AT&amp;T led with a $5.9B expenditure (up from $4.4B), followed by Exxon Mobil ($5.6B), Pfizer ($4.6B), IBM ($2.6B), and J P Morgan ($2.6B)Given all of the talk and authorizations, there is great expectation for the second quarter, especially from Apple, which announced a record authorization.Share prices for Q2,’13 are running 6.3% higher than Q1,’13 and 19.3% higher than Q2,’12. This means that companies will need to spend more just to buy back the same number of shares, and spend additional funds if they wish to create share count reduction. They talked the talk, now we’ll see if they walk the walk.(FYI-cash has again set a new record, be it by 0.17% gain)"

		"post_content" : "<em><strong>What is your long term outlook for gold and where do you see prices moving in the months ahead?</strong> </em>This is one of the questions I was recently asked in a Reuters CCTV2 interview.  While we are not in the business of forecasting, we are in the indexing business where we measure markets-and gold is one of those markets.Oftentimes the future follows history, so historical index levels are a reasonable place to look in order to get a feel for how prices have behaved in the past.  Please see below for a chart of historical levels of the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/indices/commodities/sp-gsci-gold\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI Gold</a>.[caption id=\"attachment_943\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"484\"]<a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SP-GSCI-Gold-TR.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-943\" alt=\"Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

This month it is up 8.5% so if the rally looks like last time, there may be about 30% left, but that is only if the rally this time follows the symmetry of history. Another possibility is that gold could fall another 30% and have a loss like in the 1980-82 period.What prompted the interview on July 22 was the biggest one day move of gold since June 29, 2012. See the Q&amp;A below for the <strong>OTHER GOLDEN QUESTIONS</strong>:<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">1. <em>Gold reached a one month high earlier today-it was the biggest 1-day rally in over a year. What triggered today’s rally?</em>  </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Gold gained 3.6% in the S&amp;P GSCI and DJUBS mainly on some weaker than expected data from the <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Fed</a> that drove the price higher than 1300, an important point for technical traders. It went further and  broke 1307, then 1315.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">2.<em> Why has gold dropped precipitously this year? </em></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Gold had it <a title=\"Risky Assets, Safe Havens, or Lost Identities?\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/06/21/risky-assets-safe-havens-or-lost-identities/\" target=\"_blank\">worst two days since 1980</a> mainly since the US Fed announced in June it would slow its quantitative easing. The demand for gold as a safe haven may have disappeared after that announcement.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">3. <em>And-what’s behind the 10% rebound this month?</em> </span>The rebound is on the fundamental story of expanding reserves from the banks, whether it’s the Fed, ECB or Bank of Japan, the demand is picking up while the ETF selloff seems to have eased.[caption id=\"attachment_953\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"393\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-953\" alt=\"Source: Blackrock.

		"post_content" : "My colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/david_blitzer/\" target=\"_blank\">David Blitzer</a>, is discussing index construction in his blog series <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/category/market-blitz/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Inside the S&amp;P 500\"</a>, and so far has reviewed <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/09/inside-the-sp-500-selecting-stocks/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting stocks</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/30/inside-the-sp-500-float-adjustment/\" target=\"_blank\">float adjustment</a>. While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.Since 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don't necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">'alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb'</a>.He couldn't have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months. For them, alternative beta that <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">modified rolls</a> or <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weights</a> may have seemed to be the smarter solution since backwardation was a thing of the past. However, today that wisdom may not hold true because w</span>hile the <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\">persistence of backwardation</a> hasn't been seen since prior to 2005, backwardation (as measured by the difference between the excess return and price return versions of the  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a>), appeared in 5 months in 2012 an has now continued this year since May.There is a noticeable shift of world growth that may be causing backwardation to reappear. A number of <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/article/coming-new-world-order-revolution-how-things-will-change-next-20-years-kondratieff-cycle-per\" target=\"_blank\">characteristics of world growth</a> driven by expansion of demand are becoming more widespread by the move from world growth driven by expansion of supply.  These factors are getting stronger since last year and they may drive the frequency and magnitude of cycles higher that may increase the incidence of switching between contango and backwardation.<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/NWO%201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1045\" alt=\"New World\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New-World.jpg\" width=\"1065\" height=\""

The biggest contributor in July was also one of the biggest stocks, Apple, which saw its stock rise 59 points to 452.5 and added 6.2 index points of the total 72.5 index point gain the S&amp;P 500 index enjoyed. At the other end of the list was Microsoft, which lost 2.8 points to close at 31.83 and subtracted 2.4 index points from the S&amp;P 500.These are two of the larger stocks in the index, so it shouldn't be a surprise that they were at the extremes of adding, or removing performance from the overall index.The same analysis can be done with any division of the S&amp;P 500, or any other index providing one can calculate both weights and performance. Is it more buyers than sellers? No, it's what they're buying or selling and how big the things being bought and sold are when compared to the index or the market."

		"post_content" : "My colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/david_blitzer/\" target=\"_blank\">David Blitzer</a>, is discussing index construction in his blog series <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/category/market-blitz/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Inside the S&amp;P 500\"</a>, and so far has reviewed <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/09/inside-the-sp-500-selecting-stocks/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting stocks</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/30/inside-the-sp-500-float-adjustment/\" target=\"_blank\">float adjustment</a>. While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.Since 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don't necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">'alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb'</a>.He couldn't have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months. For them, alternative beta that <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">modified rolls</a> or <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weights</a> may have seemed to be the smarter solution since backwardation was a thing of the past. However, today that wisdom may not hold true because w</span>hile the <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\">persistence of backwardation</a> hasn't been seen since prior to 2005, backwardation (as measured by the difference between the excess return and price return versions of the  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a>), appeared in 5 months in 2012 an has now continued this year since May.There is a noticeable shift of world growth that may be causing backwardation to reappear. A number of <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/article/coming-new-world-order-revolution-how-things-will-change-next-20-years-kondratieff-cycle-per\" target=\"_blank\">characteristics of world growth</a> driven by expansion of demand are becoming more widespread by the move from world growth driven by expansion of supply.  These factors are getting stronger since last year and they may drive the frequency and magnitude of cycles higher that may increase the incidence of switching between contango and backwardation.<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/NWO%201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1045\" alt=\"New World\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New-World.jpg\" width=\"1065\" heigh"

It is these very types of protections that regulatory bodies should embrace, rather than adopting practices that threaten the very philosophies that made indexing as reliable and popular as it is today."

		"post_content" : "My colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/david_blitzer/\" target=\"_blank\">David Blitzer</a>, is discussing index construction in his blog series <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/category/market-blitz/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Inside the S&amp;P 500\"</a>, and so far has reviewed <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/09/inside-the-sp-500-selecting-stocks/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting stocks</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/30/inside-the-sp-500-float-adjustment/\" target=\"_blank\">float adjustment</a>. While the index construction principles of transparency, liquidity, and systematic rules-based methodologies are widely similar between equities, commodities and other asset classes, there are details that distinguish the asset classes. For example, market capitalization and style like growth or value may be associated with equities while credit quality and duration may be linked with bonds. The main features of commodity indices are <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+weight&amp;Search=SEARCH&amp;Search=SEARCH\" target=\"_blank\">weightings</a>, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/search/?query=modified+roll&amp;Search=Search&amp;sortType=Relevance&amp;ContentType=Index&amp;AssetFamily=all-commodities\" target=\"_blank\">rolls</a>, and <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-wci\" target=\"_blank\">regions</a>.Since 2007, there have been a number of new commodity indices created to modify the first-generation flagships, the <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a>, intended to improve the returns and reduce risk. However, as my colleague, <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/author/craig_lazzara/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Lazzara</a>, points out, newer developments to flagship indices don't necessarily create smart beta so he prefers the term <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef9c2212-d4db-11e2-9302-00144feab7de.html\" target=\"_blank\">'alternative beta, because calling it smart beta implies the beta you get from the S&amp;P 500 (or flagship) is dumb'</a>.He couldn't have stated that concept any better for commodities. The <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.djindexes.com/commodity/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ-UBS</a> have been criticized for their basic strategy of holding the most liquid front-month contracts that lose from negative roll yield when exiting the expiring contract and entering the new contract every month when the later-dated contract is more expensive, or in <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">contango</a>. The blame comes from <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">investors who were allocating to commodities i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">n the time period between 2005 and 2011 when contango was the prevailing condition in 93% of months.

However, today that wisdom may not hold true because w</span>hile the <a title=\"Keeping Up With Contango’s Twist\" href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/2013/07/08/keeping-up-with-contangos-twist/\">persistence of backwardation</a> hasn't been seen since prior to 2005, backwardation (as measured by the difference between the excess return and price return versions of the  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/index-family/commodities/sp-gsci\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P GSCI</a>), appeared in 5 months in 2012 an has now continued this year since May.There is a noticeable shift of world growth that may be causing backwardation to reappear.

However, if the dividends were reinvested in the index, the investment would be worth $10,635 by the end of July.Reinvesting the dividends roughly doubled the value of the investment.Looking at the same time period, the annual return earned by the total return index was 9.71% and by the price index was 6.96%, a spread of 2.75%. <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/500TR.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1134\" alt=\"500TR\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/500TR-1024x791.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"482\" /></a>"

		"post_content" : "For what risk does the commodity investor get paid? At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk gets passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.Let's address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX-commodity link. Please see below for the chart of fundamental sources and components of commodity returns and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXbnyL7L-E&amp;list=TLtf5reSX02bw\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> to hear more about them in an educational slideshow.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-Commodity-Return-Sources.jpg\" alt=\"5 Commodity Return Sources\" width=\"623\" height=\"409\" />The insurance risk premium is available to long-only commodity investors since there is a gap that needs to be filled between producers and commercial consumers that are hedging. Remember, the futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against price drops and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward price pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.  This results in net short hedging pressure from physical users as shown in the graph below:<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1297\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hedging-Pressure.jpg\" alt=\"Hedging Pressure\" width=\"493\" height=\"372\" />This leads us to the second question, \"At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato?\"As published in a <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper by Cheng et al.</a>, while in normal times, or in other words \"pre-crisis\", commodity investors accommodate the needs of commercial producers by providing the aforementioned insurance by taking the long side of the futures contracts that the commercial consumers forego. However, in times of financial distress, or \"post-crisis\",  commodity investors reduce their net long positions in response to an increase in the risk as measured by VIX, causing the risk to flow back to the hedgers.What is happening, as <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/commodity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tang and Xiong argue</a>, is that although the risk sharing improves as the presence of commodity index traders increases, the expense of risk spillover from outside markets increases.  Simply stated, the risk for investors to provide insurance becomes too high to bear. Like the convection of a current of air that flows from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the risk flows from the more distressed commodity index investors to the less distressed hedgers-beginning the game of \"hot potato\" since no one wants to hold the risk. The result is a collapse in <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp\" target=\"_blank\">open interest</a> as shown in <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Cheng's paper</a> in the table below.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1301\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VIX-Commodity-Open-Interest.jpg\" alt=\"VIX Commodity Open Interest\" width=\"602\" height=\"390\" />How does this translate into linking VIX spikes to commodity dips? Using weekly return data on a rolling basis daily back to January 1990, of a total of 215 times that VIX spiked more than 20%, 142 occurred prior to Sept 2008 and 73 occurred after Sept 2008. In the pre-crisis, of the 142 times that VIX spiked &gt;20%, commodities fell 82 times or 58% of the time with an average return of 6 basis points during the weeks of VIX spikes. However, the post crisis number of weeks on a rolling basis where VIX spiked &gt;20% was 73 and commodity returns were negative 65 of those times or 89% with an average return of -3.4%.

The Dow was created by Dow Jones &amp; Company, the published of the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>and is now owned and maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.It is price-weighted meaning that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the 30 stocks and dividing by the divisor. The divisor is used to prevent the index from changing when the stocks are changed. With price weighting, the highest price stock, IBM carries about 23 times more weight in the index than the lowest price stock, Alcoa.In fact, IBM has twice as much weight and a bigger impact on the index than ExxonMobil even though ExxonMobil is almost twice as large as IBM measured by market value.The S&amp;P 500 is a relative new comer.It took its present form of 500 stocks in 1957 when the Standard Statistics 90 Stock Index, created in 1926, became the S&amp;P 500.The 500 is value-weighted (sometimes called cap-weighted).The market value of all 500 companies is totaled and divided by a divisor. The divisor serves the same function for the 500 as it does for the Dow, preventing jumps when stocks are replaced. Since not every share of every stock is readily available in the market-some shares are closely held and rarely traded-the index is float adjusted to exclude closely held shares.

Further, because the market is value weighted, the returns and volatilities measured with the S&amp;P 500 give returns and volatility for the market.Overall both indices are widely followed and both are used to analyze and predict the market and to invest or manage risk through investment products based on the indices."

The Dow was created by Dow Jones &amp; Company, the published of the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>and is now owned and maintained by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.It is price-weighted meaning that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the 30 stocks and dividing by the divisor. The divisor is used to prevent the index from changing when the stocks are changed. With price weighting, the highest price stock, IBM carries about 23 times more weight in the index than the lowest price stock, Alcoa.In fact, IBM has twice as much weight and a bigger impact on the index than ExxonMobil even though ExxonMobil is almost twice as large as IBM measured by market value.The S&amp;P 500 is a relative new comer.It took its present form of 500 stocks in 1957 when the Standard Statistics 90 Stock Index, created in 1926, became the S&amp;P 500.The 500 is value-weighted (sometimes called cap-weighted).The market value of all 500 companies is totaled and divided by a divisor. The divisor serves the same function for the 500 as it does for the Dow, preventing jumps when stocks are replaced. Since not every share of every stock is readily available in the market-some shares are closely held and rarely traded-the index is float adjusted to exclude closely held shares. Each company’s weight in the index is proportional to its size.For instance, ExxonMobil’s weight will be twice that of IBM in the S&amp;P 500 unlike the price-weighted DJIA.Because of the different weighting methods and the much larger number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 than the DJIA, the range from largest to smallest company, or highest to lowest price, is much greater for the S&amp;P 500.  The larger number of stocks in the 500 also makes it possible to divide the index and compare the performance of different parts of the market using sectors (technology, utilities, health care, financials, etc.) or styles (growth and value). Further, because the market is value weighted, the returns and volatilities measured with the S&amp;P 500 give returns and volatility for the market.Overall both indices are widely followed and both are used to analyze and predict the market and to invest or manage risk through investment products based on the indices."

		"post_content" : "Markets and investors both seem to be thinking about August vacations and little else these days. As we enter the second full week of August-or the third week before Labor Day for the pessimists and workaholics-things seem to be going quiet.The Dell buyout, just about the only contested M&amp;A action, is postponed until next month. Trading volumes are down, VIX is in the low teens or less, and even the European debt problems seem to be on vacation with most of the continent. Lest we all go to sleep, a few reminders about things to come and where we are now may be in order.The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/your-money/this-ironman-market-is-still-lacking-respect.html?ref=business&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> noted that the S&amp;P 500 is on a strong streak-it started in 2012 and 2013 with first day gains and hasn’t revisited those starting points since in a demonstration of staying power. Actually the bull market began on March 9<sup>th</sup> 2009 with the S&amp;P 500 at 676.53 about 56 months ago. On Friday August 9<sup>th</sup> the index closed at 1691.42, a rise of 150%.This is a touch below the average bull market gain of 163%; the average life for a bull market is 56 month.By either measure we could keep going for quite some time; but also by either measure an end in the near future wouldn’t look unusual compared to history.There are two places to look for possible answers to the question of what might happen next to the market.<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">First, returns depend on three interrelated factors: earnings growth, PE expansion and dividends.Most analysts expect continued earnings growth; the dividend yield at 2% currently is a small positive while the PE at 17x on trailing earnings is a bit high but not frightening.All this suggests that most investors should feel comfortable during this August vacation. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">The second answer to what might happen to upset the apple cart? Several things: sooner or later the Fed will shift policy, QE3 will fade out and interest rates will rise. Those who doubt this matters should remember May and June this year.That experience showed that the damage can come quickly and at any hint of a shift at the central bank.Sometime this fall the President will nominate a new Fed chairman.  Either of the two most discussed candidates-Janet Yellin and Larry Summers-is qualified for the job.But changing the leadership in any organization means slower decision making, shifting people and positions and readjustments. It raises the risks that things don’t run as smoothly as we’re accustomed to.  Besides the Fed there is fiscal policy -- either Congress will raise the debt ceiling in the next few months or the US government will default. The debt ceiling will be raised but probably not without a lot of politics and nervousness which won’t play very well in the markets or anywhere else. </span>Washington DC isn’t the only source of post-Labor Day market anxiety.There’s a long list of slowing growth in China, those unresolved European debt crises, turmoil in Egypt, war in Syria, and nuclear issues in various countries.For this bull market to beat the averages by a large margin we have a high wall of worry to climb."

		"post_content" : "For what risk does the commodity investor get paid? At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.Let's address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX-commodity link. Please see below for the chart of fundamental sources and components of commodity returns and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXbnyL7L-E&amp;list=TLtf5reSX02bw\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> to hear more about them in a video.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" alt=\"5 Commodity Return Sources\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-Commodity-Return-Sources.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"409\" />The futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against a price drop and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery."

		"post_content" : "S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices released their foreign sales reports today (bit.ly/1eGKVbf ). The top-line items are that foreign sales increased (46.6% from 46.1%), Asian sales continued to grow as European sales continued to decline, and S&amp;P 500 issues reversed their income tax payments and sent more to Washington in 2012 than they sent abroad (51.2% in 2012 compared to 45.3% in 2011). The bottom-line item, however, is taxes. There is battle brewing over who should pay what, and I believe that battle will emulate the health care debate, and be just as divisive. Corporations pay what is required, and if there is a legal way to reduce their payment, they will take it, and rightfully so (I feel). The issue is the rules, and that is where we should be focused on. Fairness, economic implications, and social policy all have a part in the rules. It would be nice to believe that when congress returns they will focus in on those issues, but with all due respect to my compliance people-I fear that past performance will be indicative of future returns.<strong>S&amp;P 500 sales:</strong>In 2012, European sales declined to 9.7% of all S&amp;P 500 sales, down from 11.1% in 2011 and 13.5% in 2010U.K. representation declined to 1.7% from 2.4% in 2011European ex-U.K. sales declined to 8.0%, from 8.7% in 2011 and 12.0% in 2010Asian sales increased to 7.5% of all sales, from 7.2% in 2011 and 6.1% in 2010Canadian sales declined to 4.1% of all sales from 4.3% in 2011Information technology continued to be the most successful and exposed sector in terms of foreign sales, with 58.3% of its declared sales being foreignThe sector represents 16.2% of all U.S. foreign sales, down from 19.0% in 2011S&amp;P 500 companies reversed their payments and sent more money to Washington for income taxes than they did to foreign governmentsPayments to Washington increased 24.2% to $145.8 billion, as payments abroad declined 1.8% to $139.1 billion51.2% of declared income taxes were paid to the U.S. and 48.8% were paid to foreign governmentsA slight uptick in the companies reporting foreign sales data was noted, however, almost half of the S&amp;P 500 issues still do not report sufficient information to facilitate producing a complete report on global sales.For the S&amp;P 500, 46.6% of all sales are estimated to have been produced and sold outside of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 46.1% in 2011 and 46.3% in 2010.<strong>Observation/Commentary:</strong>At this point it is not just about tax rates and credits, but in what domain the sales and profits are registered in. <strong>Tax policy has now become a major issue with the public debate expected to grow substantially, emulating the levels and political turmoil which surrounded the health care debate.</strong>While European sales are down, they are still a major component of U.S. sales, with their growth expectations having now been scaled back. Asian sales are increasing, and just as relevant is the production which is done there and imported back to the U.S. The Heartland of America (manufacturing) is returning, with the question being how much can it grow given U.S. economic and social costs, as companies continue to cut-costs and have difficulties passing along higher costs. Retail issues show the impact quicker to foreign sales and currency, as consumers can quickly decide to change their spending habits (COH, TIF, MCD); decision for major purchases, such as equipment (CAT) can take months to decide or change.An upturn after last year’s tick down, but Asia continues to increase as Europe continues to decrease.<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAn4AAAEFCAIAAADyv32oAAAgAElEQVR4nO19P28cubL9fAd/gwkcbqZ4AjmcQHCkRMr1AQzBiYAHv/vCxS8TBKfrTItN7UAQoMDBBawbGDfQw/ygwIAMGAYW9ia7EV9Qd0ulqiKb0zPWkFPnoAHLHDabp1nk4b9mTf538f9x4cKFCxcuXI9zpZQm9A8ANI6Ahsq1NBQCUk5gHQmQXqAnBDRUSG8cgHUcQHqBnhDQUCG9cQDWcQDpBXpCQEOF9MYBWMcBpBfoCQENFdIbB2AdB770fv/++3w6nUwmk8lkOp3//v07/3R6ckjhu/vHf/71l41PePLkp8WnO/UwG+3w5PQHETs9OVQ5/6EgavKdlPHXX38e7+9SDuXfPzqfvSNgLYX0xgFYx4EjvVIJlKJcnJ9NJpOr65ub66vJZHJ2fkG3qGj0X6u+FM5ye/dp8dOTJz9IfSG9W4mAtRTSGwdgHQeO9CqBlGDpVapphYdjytttyqcnh+74eHV0JL0/Om/bhIC1FNIbB2AdB1npdVWBftqZHxzMd6RkjpZeGj1TNFIjOcut9InSpKH2oNRJ6bUpyxRevXhOP3Fu5cQ4P0ImYp8r81NImbosk8nk+YtXuVEvx5ET8iOytJUIWEshvXEA1nHgr/WSItoGndt6JczuhLMV75z0np1fyFukFEkJp2Vmeoqa8bZg6c2lLGfFXeFUf3NOCr0KeVc5ZdLXXK7oFamXs2yWthIBaymkNw7AOg5KO5x5RxUpgdokRSu+1Nwvtc3KlV4lpfxfkiiWn3/84x8syeWZapbeXMpSw6T4qfj8IJK33Mp0Th1zKefWeuU0gH1LS2VpKxGwlkJ64wCs42Dg4yJSBdnQS9F69eK5uxsrh8KEsxq3sdhQBnb3jxeLj/Odg9u724Od+cfFggILj2PpzaWcE0iKr3B1fSNnd2tGvbmU5ex6eZTPGJelrUTAWgrpjQOwjoPh73rdWU0WAzkgHiG9vM0qNzalZ02n89evX+3uH3/749vx/u6r16/n06mabS6PI0ePei0oghprPuaotzJLW4mAtRTSGwdgHQeO9Mp2XKqC3NXMi8GrjHplgrkV2SS2HVFMUn13tpk7B/JB5bVeK5C5cJp+593dSghrpFeG0wss52qwl1DO0lYiYC2F9MYBWMeBP+qVM5xS5FhxSQipxWepq5ReOWsqB2ruPmQZTmNBykPuWe6JH+UdzkrPVD7dbdKVO5xtymvZ4VyZpa1EwFoK6Y0DsI4DHCQJ9ISAhgrpjQOwjgNIL9ATAhoqpDcOwDoOI"

Sector variance showed that mid- and small-cap issues had slightly higher concentration in Health Care and less in Information Technology and Finance. Top-line foreign sales exposure seems to reduce with size, but bottom-line income may be a different story.  Large-caps may be able to control more of their fate through ownership, joint ventures and the ability to hedge currencies to protect costs.  Smaller-caps appear to have to go with the flow more-so if they are currently importing component parts from Japan, they are saving a few cents.  I’ll put together a report later in the month."

		"post_content" : "For what risk does the commodity investor get paid? At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.Let's address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX-commodity link. Please see below for the chart of fundamental sources and components of commodity returns and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXbnyL7L-E&amp;list=TLtf5reSX02bw\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> to hear more about them in a video.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" alt=\"5 Commodity Return Sources\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-Commodity-Return-Sources.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"409\" />The futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against a price drop and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery."

Using weekly return data on a rolling basis daily back to January 1990, of a total of 215 times that VIX spiked more than 20%, 142 occurred prior to Sept 2008 and 73 occurred after Sept 2008. In the pre-crisis, of the 142 times that VIX spiked &gt;20%, commodities fell 82 times or 58% of the time with an average return of 6 basis points during the weeks of VIX spikes. However, the post crisis number of weeks on a rolling basis where VIX spiked &gt;20% was 73 and commodity returns were negative 65 of those times or 89% with an average return of -3.4%.

The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.Let's address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX-commodity link.

Remember, the futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against a price drop and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1.

Please see below for the chart of fundamental sources and components of commodity returns and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXbnyL7L-E&amp;list=TLtf5reSX02bw\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> to hear more about them in an educational slideshow.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" alt=\"5 Commodity Return Sources\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-Commodity-Return-Sources.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"409\" />The insurance risk premium is available to long-only commodity investors since there is a gap that needs to be filled between producers and commercial consumers that are hedging. Remember, the futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against price drops and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.  This results in net short hedging pressure from physical users as shown in the graph below:<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1297\" alt=\"Hedging Pressure\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hedging-Pressure.jpg\" width=\"493\" height=\"372\" />This leads us to the second question, \"At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato?\"As published in a <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper by Cheng et al.</a>, while in normal times, or in other words \"pre-crisis\", commodity investors accommodate the needs of commercial producers by providing the aforementioned insurance by taking the long side of the futures contracts that the commercial consumers forego. However, in times of financial distress, or \"post-crisis\",  commodity investors reduce their net long positions in response to an increase in the risk as measured by VIX, causing the risk to flow back to the hedgers.What is happening, as <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/commodity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tang and Xiong argue</a>, is that although the risk sharing improves as the presence of commodity index traders increases, the expense of risk spillover from outside markets increases.  Simply stated, the risk for investors to provide insurance becomes too high to bear. Like the convection of a current of air that flows from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, the risk flows from the more distressed commodity index investors to the the less distressed hedgers-beginning the game of \"hot potato\" since no one wants to hold the risk. The result is a collapse in <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp\" target=\"_blank\">open interest</a> as shown in <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Cheng's paper</a> in the table below.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1301\" alt=\"VIX Commodity Open Interest\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VIX-Commodity-Open-Interest.jpg\" width=\"602\" height=\"390\" />How does this translate into linking VIX spikes to commodity dips?

In the pre-crisis, of the 142 times that VIX spiked &gt;20%, commodities fell 82 times or 58% of the time with an average return of 6 basis points during the weeks of VIX spikes. However, the post crisis number of weeks on a rolling basis where VIX spiked &gt;20% was 73 and commodity returns were negative 65 of those times or 89% with an average return of -3.4%.

The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.Let's address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX-commodity link.

Remember, the futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against price drops and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward price pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.  This results in net short hedging pressure from physical users as shown in the graph below:<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1297\" alt=\"Hedging Pressure\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hedging-Pressure.jpg\" width=\"493\" height=\"372\" />This leads us to the second question, \"At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato?\"As published in a <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper by Cheng et al.</a>, while in normal times, or in other words \"pre-crisis\", commodity investors accommodate the needs of commercial producers by providing the aforementioned insurance by taking the long side of the futures contracts that the commercial consumers forego. However, in times of financial distress, or \"post-crisis\",  commodity investors reduce their net long positions in response to an increase in the risk as measured by VIX, causing the risk to flow back to the hedgers.What is happening, as <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/commodity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tang and Xiong argue</a>, is that although the risk sharing improves as the presence of commodity index traders increases, the expense of risk spillover from outside markets increases.  Simply stated, the risk for investors to provide insurance becomes too high to bear.

		"post_content" : "For what risk does the commodity investor get paid? At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk gets passed like a hot potato? The answers to these questions will help explain why post the global financial crisis there has been a link between VIX spikes and commodity losses.Let's address the first question of what risk the commodity investor takes to be compensated. While there are five fundamental sources that drive the commodity asset class returns, the insurance risk premium is a major source of return and is the one behind the VIX-commodity link. Please see below for the chart of fundamental sources and components of commodity returns and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXbnyL7L-E&amp;list=TLtf5reSX02bw\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> to hear more about them in an educational slideshow.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" alt=\"5 Commodity Return Sources\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5-Commodity-Return-Sources.jpg\" width=\"623\" height=\"409\" />The insurance risk premium is available to long-only commodity investors since there is a gap that needs to be filled between producers and commercial consumers that are hedging. Remember, the futures markets exist to facilitate hedging, not to forecast prices. The producers go short to protect against price drops and the consumers go long to protect against price increases. However, the producers need protection against price drops more than consumers need protection against price increases. The reason this is the case is supported by two economic theories: 1. Hicks' theory of congenital weakness that argues it is easier for consumers to choose alternatives so they are less vulnerable to price increases than producers are to price drops, and 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Money-Theory-Collected-Keynes/dp/0333107241\" target=\"_blank\">Keynes' theory of \"normal backwardation\"</a> that argues producers sell commodities in advance at a discount which causes downward price pressure, which converges to the spot at the time of delivery.  This results in net short hedging pressure from physical users as shown in the graph below:<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1297\" alt=\"Hedging Pressure\" src=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hedging-Pressure.jpg\" width=\"493\" height=\"372\" />This leads us to the second question, \"At what point is the fear gauge so high the risk needs to be passed like a hot potato?\"As published in a <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/RiskConvection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper by Cheng et al.</a>, while in normal times, or in other words \"pre-crisis\", commodity investors accommodate the needs of commercial producers by providing the aforementioned insurance by taking the long side of the futures contracts that the commercial consumers forego. However, in times of financial distress, or \"post-crisis\",  commodity investors reduce their net long positions in response to an increase in the risk as measured by VIX, causing the risk to flow back to the hedgers.What is happening, as <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/commodity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tang and Xiong argue</a>, is that although the risk sharing improves as the presence of commodity index traders increases, the expense of risk spillover from outside markets increases.  Simply stated, the risk for investors to provide insurance becomes too high to bear.

		"post_content" : "Multi-asset strategies have been traditionally offered via active management. Institutional and high net worth investors have used multi-asset strategies to meet their specific needs such as matching liabilities and achieving absolute returns. As the indexing industry evolves beyond asset class beta and systematic risk premia, we are starting to see multi-asset investment solutions offered in a pre-packaged index format. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices offers a suite of multi-asset strategies ranging from target date to target volatility indices. The table below highlights examples of multi-asset solutions that have been indexed or can potentially be indexed.In our recent paper, <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/documents/research/the-role-of-multi-asset-solutions-in-indexing.pdf?force_download=true\" target=\"_blank\">The Role of Multi-Asset Solutions in Indexing</a>, we cover a number of multi-asset solutions that can be indexed. We discuss three case studies in detail: risk parity, income generation and inflation protection. Our analysis shows that portfolio risk can be mitigated by diversifying across asset classes while meeting the specific investment objective, whether it’s income, inflation protection or balanced asset class risk exposure.<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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"

		"post_content" : "Despite strong double-digit gains in the equity markets last year, S&amp;P 500 issues posted record pension and OPEB underfunding in 2012. The double-digit equity gains of 2012 were no match for the artificially low interest rates which vaulted pension liabilities into record underfunding territory. Companies have only 77 cents for each dollar they owe in pensions and only 22 cents for each dollar of OPEB obligations. Overall, pensions and OPEB remain a manageable expense, currently within income and assets levels. Pensions funding should improve since interest rates have risen -&gt; the higher the interest rate used the lower the discounted liabilities.The full report, \"S&amp;P 500 2012 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB): The Final Frontier\", can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.spdji.com/sp500\">www.spdji.com/sp500.</a><b>Defined pensions</b> underfunding set a new record at $451.7B in 2012, up $97B billion from $354.7B in 2011 (up $206.7B from $245B in 2010). The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.41% and the S&amp;P Global BMI ex-U.S. added 14.05%, but it’s what you owe more than what you have. Pension funding rate decreased to 77.3% from 78.8% in 2011 (83.9% in 2010). Pension return rates declined for the 12th consecutive year, to 7.31% from 7.60% in 2011 (7.73% in 2010). Discount rates declined for the fourth year in a row, falling 78bps to 3.93% from 4.71% in 2011 (5.31% in 2010), significantly increasing projected obligations.Funds maintained 2011 allocations in 2012 in an attempt to manage forward risk from markets. Equity allocations ticked up to 48.6% from 48.4%. Fixed income allocations ticked down to 40.4% from 40.9%.<b>OPEB</b> underfunded increased to $234.9B from $223.4B in 2011 ($210.1B in 2010). Funding rate increased to 22.3% from 21.8%. OPEB remains a target for cuts.

		"post_content" : "Despite strong double-digit gains in the equity markets last year, S&amp;P 500 issues posted record pension and OPEB underfunding in 2012. The double-digit equity gains of 2012 were no match for the artificially low interest rates which vaulted pension liabilities into record underfunding territory. Companies have only 77 cents for each dollar they owe in pensions and only 22 cents for each dollar of OPEB obligations. Overall, pensions and OPEB remain a manageable expense, currently within income and assets levels. Pensions funding should improve since interest rates have risen -&gt; the higher the interest rate used the lower the discounted liabilities.The full report, \"S&amp;P 500 2012 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB): The Final Frontier\", can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.spdji.com/sp500\">www.spdji.com/sp500.</a><b>Defined pensions</b> underfunding set a new record at $451.7B in 2012, up $97B billion from $354.7B in 2011 (up $206.7B from $245B in 2010). The S&amp;P 500 rose 13.41% and the S&amp;P Global BMI ex-U.S. added 14.05%, but it’s what you owe more than what you have. Pension funding rate decreased to 77.3% from 78.8% in 2011 (83.9% in 2010). Pension return rates declined for the 12th consecutive year, to 7.31% from 7.60% in 2011 (7.73% in 2010). Discount rates declined for the fourth year in a row, falling 78 bps to 3.93% from 4.71% in 2011 (5.31% in 2010), significantly increasing projected obligations.Funds maintained 2011 allocations in 2012 in an attempt to manage forward risk from markets. Equity allocations ticked up to 48.6% from 48.4%. Fixed income allocations ticked down to 40.4% from 40.9%.<b>OPEB</b> underfunded increased to $234.9B from $223.4B in 2011 ($210.1B in 2010).
