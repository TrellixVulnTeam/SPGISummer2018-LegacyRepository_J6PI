I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain. )</blockquote>...or something like this:<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>As a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href=\"https://dev.indexologyblog.com/wp-admin/\">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.

  "post_title" : "National Credit Default Rates Decreased in February 2013 According to the S&P/Experian Consumer Credit Default Indices",
  "post_content" : "<strong><em>Three of the Five Cities Saw Default Rates Descend in February 2013</em></strong><strong>New York, March 19, 2013</strong>-Data through February 2013, released today by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Experian for the S&amp;P/Experian Consumer Credit Default Indices, a comprehensive measure of changes in consumer credit defaults, showed a decrease in national default rates during the month. The national composite was 1.55% in February, down from 1.63% in January.The first mortgage default rate moved down to 1.48% in February, from 1.58% in January. The bank card rate was 3.37% in February vs. 3.41% in January. The second mortgage and auto loan default rates increased in February posting 0.71% and 1.11%; they were marginally up from their respective 0.69% and 1.10% January levels.'Consumer credit quality remains healthy', says David M. Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. 'The first mortgage and bank card default rates moved down, the second mortgage and auto loans were marginally up in February. All loan types remain below their respective levels a year ago.'These trends are consistent with other economic news-improvements in employment and overall economic activity and continuing gains in housing. Additionally, foreclosure activity continues to decline even though it remains at elevated levels compared to the period before the financial crisis.'Three of the five cities we cover showed decreases in their default rates in February-New York was down by 12 basis points, Los Angeles by 18 and Miami by 24 basis points. Chicago was marginally up by one basis point and Dallas was up by seven basis points. Miami had the highest default rate at 3.21% and Dallas-the lowest at 1.26% among the five cities. All five cities remain below default rates they posted a year ago, in February 2012.'The table below summarizes the February 2013 results for the S&amp;P/Experian Credit Default Indices.

  "post_title" : "Recent Changes in India-Impetus for ETF Growth?",
  "post_content" : "Since its inception a decade ago, ETFs’ in India have clocked significant growth. The number of ETFs’ and ETP listed has grown to 37 and are spread across Gold and Equity with a single money market ETF. While the assets are currently at $2bn, there are changes afoot which will see the ETF business undergo an important transformation over the next few years. A noteworthy change was the reduction in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) for designated equity investments from 10 bps to 1 bp which reduced creation/ redemption/ trading costs and resulted in narrower spreads.<strong>Retail Investment</strong>In the past few years, Reserve Bank of India* and the SEBI*, have taken an initiative to promulgate an RDR-style regulation along with the advent of a commission free-direct share class (known as a ‘direct plan’). The regulation (SEBI Advisor Regulation) mandates registration of all intermediaries as either distributors (where they get paid by the manufacturer for distribution) or advisors (paid by clients for advice). For such advisors, ETFs’ make ideal building blocks for designing and managing investment pools including optimized asset allocation strategies to more sophisticated target date portfolios. The low cost ensures the returns are better and the transparency improves ex-ante risk management. An ETF based portfolio, therefore, becomes an attractive option for advisors who wish to efficiently manage client portfolios and charge an advisory fee (to offset revenue shortfall as a result of said advisory regulation).Additionally, the government has introduced ISA (UK) /401K (US) type tax incentives which give retail investors a tax break on ETF investments. While the scheme is clearly targeted at attracting long term money to equity markets, it has the potential to introduce a hereto untapped segment. <strong>Institutional Market Developments</strong>At the moment, all insurance and pension funds are managed in house and list of eligible securities is small. For all such funds, additional restrictions apply including limiting 1.5% of the portfolio for mutual fund investments (including ETF) and a prohibition on investing in parent company shares. This prevents fund managers access to inexpensive beta exposures and even manager selection. Proposed changes to the Insurance and Pension Fund (and Mutual Fund regulations) regulation envisages allowing all three categories to invest into ETFs’. This would open up a $400 bn growing market for ETF manufacturers. While domestic ETF cater to the demand for wider market exposure and as elements in quantitative strategies, foreign ETFs’ will be required to diversify portfolios.Given these changes and the launch of the government promoted Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) ETF one can expect to see a proliferation of both domestic and foreign ETFs’. <em>*Note:Reserve Bank of India regulates the bond and money markets (and consequently, banks)Securities and Exchanges Board of India regulates the capital marketsInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulates Insurance Companies and FundsPension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority regulates all government and private pension fundsForward Markets Commission regulates all commodity markets</em>"
