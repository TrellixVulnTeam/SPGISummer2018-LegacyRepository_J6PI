## Introduction
My name is Salvador Villalon and I am Software Developer Intern
at S&P Dow Jones Indices for Summer 2018. My manager Sharath Srinivas gave me all sorts of projects
that expose me to different fields of Technology. This repository consist of all the things I did throughout the internship.


# The Projects

<br>

## Campus Recruiting Mockup Directory
#### In This Project...
- I remember back when I was applying to S&P Global for the Global IT Technology Internship Program, I wanted to learn more about what the internship program and what I could expect. I felt that the current website that they have did not provide the information I looked for or exposure to S&P Global. I decided to create a Mockup for this website based on what I have seen in other websites and something that can benefit future students interested in learning about S&P Global.

- **Mockup directory**
  - This directory contains a draft and final folder which have the mockup

- **Pictures directory** 
  - This directory contains all pictures and logos I used to create the mockup
  
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Unsplash (To get stock pictures)
  - Canva

## Container Learning Directory
#### In This Project...
- During Monday morning of Week 2 of the internship, I decided to talk with Sreedhar Athikam. During my first week he asked me what my   expectations of the internship where, but at the moment I could not answer that question. That weekend I decided to reflect on what    my expectations where so that on Monday I could talk to him about it. As we were talking, we helped me clarify goals and    expectations for the internship and from this a project emerged. I was tasked with learning about Containers and creating a simple web application that will run inside a container. 
- Many of the tutorials used Flask and a cloud service to deploy their application. I decided to learn that as well. I learned how to use Flask and deploy web applications using Google App Engine. [You can find the application here] (http://spgi2018-container-project.appspot.com/)

- **container_presentation directory**
  - This directory contains the powerpoint presentation I made. It serves as introduction to what Containers are and how you can implement them using Docker

- **container_project directory** 
  - This directory contains all the files and directories necessary to run the web application.
  
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Docker
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Python
  - Flask
  - Google App Engine
  - Git

## Jiras Directory
#### In This Project...
-  I was given a total of 4 Jiras. These Jiras where good tasks because they taught me how to use important tools such as Apache Subversion (SVN), Git, GitHub Desktop, Java and Eclipse in a team setting. I was not able to store the other jiras I accomplished in this repository, but you can find the requiremenst here.

- **first_jira directory**
  - This directory contains the first project I worked on as an intern. I had to manually created 33 update SQL queries for a database that my intern supervisor needed

## Other Directory
#### In This Project...
- During Week 8, all the Technology interns had to present an End of Summer Presentation on the work they did throughout the       summer. The interesting part is that I only had six weeks in the internship while the other interns had 8 weeks. I really had to do alot in order to catch up and give a good presentation

## Python NLTK Directory
#### In This Project...
- During Week 8 - 10, my manager wanted me to learn more about the field of Natural Language Processing. He himself was still learning as well so it was a learning experience for both us. I was learning many methods that are used to analyze text. You can find all the things I did inside the directory.

- **python_nltk directory**
  - This directory contains everything I used for this project
  
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Python
  - Gensim
  - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
  - TextBlob
  - Atom
  - Git

## REST API Learning Directory
#### In This Project...
- During Week 3 - 5, I levarage my fluency in Spanish to collaborate with an engineer from the S&P Global Mexico City Office. In this    project, I created an enhancement for an internal Web Platform. We needed to give users of this platform the ability to check if the current file they have is locked or not. To do this I created a RESTful client that consumes the services from the Box RESTful API. This RESTful client became a Java Object that other developers will use to check if the file is locked or not. 

- I also created a Java class that will represent any errors from the Box API call.

- **notes directory**
  - This directory contains notes that I took when I was working on this project. The content will be in Spanish 

- **restful_service directory**
  - This directory contains all the files I used to create the RESTful client

- **error_handling directory**
  - This directory contains all the files I used to create the Java class
  
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Java
  - Eclipse
  - Box API
  - Json
  - Postman
  - Spring Framework
  - Spanish

## Tutorial Directory
#### In This Project...
- During Week 8 - 10, apart from working on my Natural Language Processing project I started making a tutorial for how to make a web application using Flask and deploying it to the cloud using Google App Engine. I decided to make this tutorial because when I was trying to deploy it to the cloud I had a hard time working with the specific things that each cloud service had. I came across Google App Engine, but the tutorial that Google offered left something important that prevented me from deploying my application. In the tutorial, I take you to the process I did when I first started.
  - [An introduction to Web Applications and Deploying them to the Cloud]  (Link Coming Soon)
